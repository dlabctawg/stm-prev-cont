var data = [{"id":"10720010067662","body":"Mr. President, let me correct a statement I made sometime last week when we were checking into the practice of other countries with respect to airport security. We were told that of the countries in Europe, all were Government employed. That should be corrected. That is not the case. In fact, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and England, those four countries, have contracts, but they have the health benefits and the guaranteed vacation and other benefits guaranteed by the Government. It is a sort of hybrid situation. Of 102 countries around the world with significant air travel systems, only 23 use contract screeners. I think that is not the point I want to make this afternoon. No one would suggest that we take the security for the President of the United States; namely, the Secret Service, and privatize it, contract it out. Nor would anyone recommend privatizing the security that the distinguished Chair, myself, and other Senators receive, the Capitol Police, who incidentally have been working around the clock, doing an outstanding job. You can go on down the list, whether it is Customs, whether it is the Border Patrol, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service that has some 33,000 personnel, no one in the House or Senate has suggested that we contract that out. No one has suggested we contract out the Federal Bureau of Investigation with the thousands of professionals conducting the investigation right now. No one suggests that they take some 669,000 civilian workers in national defense and contract them out. In fact, there was a suggestion by the OMB earlier this year to do just that. The OMB folks called over to the Pentagon and said: We are looking at downsizing and we want to get some contracting out of 5 to 10 percent of your civilian workers. And the Department of Defense said: That will never happen. We are in the security business. Yet the big hangup is federalization, the Government taking over the responsibility of security for air travel in America. Now, we have tried after Pan Am 103 back in 1988, with more training, more hours, more supervision, extra this and extra that, to no avail; we had TWA 800 in 1996 and again the Gore commission with more training, more supervision, and what have you. And now we have 6,000 killed and 13,000 casualties. To me, it will take unmitigated gall, with the recent experiences in mind, to come forth with a contracting out proposal. Only a while ago did I learn why we are having to put up with this nonsense. All you have to do is read Roll Call, ``Airport Firms Form Alliance.'' The airport firms formed an alliance with a Swedish company and call themselves the Aviation Security Association. And who do they have as members? The contractors that want to keep continuing their misdeeds. For instance, one of the association members, Argenbright had the contract for the Dulles and Newark airports. Now, let's read about Argenbright. I find in an article on September 13 in the Miami Herald: Here we are trying to do the work of the people of America, and we don't have any Senators listening. They are listening to the lobbyists, the K Street crowd, who are down here working the different Senators, and I can't explain to them the problem of security at the airports. Mind you me, those who are falsifying records, if you please, are now saying what we have to do is have contracting out; we can't federalize. Of course, that appeals to the crowd that comes into public service by promising to get rid of the Government. ``The Government is not the solution, the Government is the problem.'' That is all they all talk about. They are thinking of what? Of next year's reelection. They are not thinking of security. They are thinking: Wait a minute now, I was going to downsize and get rid of the Government, and now I supported 18,000 screeners and some 10,000 other airport personnel--some 28,000 I am going to put on the Government payroll, and my opponent is going to say: He promised to get rid of the Government, and he went and voted to add 28,000 more Government jobs. That is the problem--along with the blooming lobbyists. They are trying to carry out their political commitments. They are not looking out for the safety of the traveling public in America. The worst thing we have ever done is give the money to the airlines. They didn't take care of the employees. I had Herb Kelleher, of Southwest Airlines, tell me he did not furlough a single employee and maintained 100 percent service. But they were all going broke. Why? Because the lobbyists took over--the same crowd that came running around hollering they were all going to go broke. Here I am fighting to do the people's work, and Senators are gathered together in their offices with all of these airline lobbyists. This is the fifth week since September 11, and we can't pass airline security. All of America wants this responsibility fixed within the Government. No one for a second, as I say, would suggest that the FBI and the Secret Service, the Border Patrol, and Customs, or any of the other security agencies--no one would suggest that the 669,000 civilians in defense be contracted out. According to the lobbyists the Government is too big, the Government can't do anything. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. Look at what is happening. Turn on your TV if you want to see what Government can do. Look at these attacks on Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. I don't know--there are some 31 different military targets, with 2 countries involved, B-2s coming all the way from Missouri, ships stationed in the Indian Ocean, planes coming off Diego Garcia--all Government, Government recruited, Government fed, Government housed, Government trained, Government deployed, with precision work that we all praise--but we can't get a Government airport security screener. Oh, no, no, that would be against my ideology. No, we want contracting out, privatization. We now know what we are putting up with in this lobbyist crowd and the silly ideology that the Government can't do anything. Well, I am proud of our Government; I am proud of our deployment. We are going to correct this situation, and we are not going to have an Executive order. I have heard word that the administration might implement an Executive order to take care of it and say Congress is dragging its feet. We are trying to go along and be bipartisan and everything else because this is a bipartisan bill, reported unanimously out of the Commerce Committee. We have been ready to vote and take amendments, consider them and vote upon them. But they are going to say now that we are going to have to get an Executive order because we are dragging our feet and can't get security out of the Congress, mind you me.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.439042363326717,"Topic 2":0.0735348899436727,"Topic 3":0.0864560981111782,"Topic 4":0.0552707680145101,"Topic 5":0.345695880603922},{"id":"10720010020319","body":"Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure to ban a horrific procedure. For my generation, we have walked in as mothers and fathers into our doctors' offices and we have had the stethoscope with amplifier hooked to the mother's stomach. We have heard the heartbeat of the child at 11 weeks fill the room with a beating and a pounding and a pulsing of life. In the second trimester in the fourth month, we walk in and with modern technology in the window through the womb we see our babies. We know whether it is a boy or a girl. We see their heartbeat, we see their arms and legs kick and move. We see them suck their thumbs. We as a generation have had the experience of being in the delivery room to actually hold a baby as it arrives, to cut the umbilical cord, to know that what was once hidden is no more, what was once a mystery is now a revelation of life. I would ask us all, then, to stand for the life that we know, to stop this horrific practice. Mr. Speaker, my generation has had the opportunity to walk into our doctor's office, and through the use of technology we have heard the beating of our unborn child's heart, we have seen the movement of the child's arms and legs. We know whether the child is a boy or girl. We have been able to be present in the delivery to room to hold the newborn child and cut the umbilical cord. What was once hidden is now known. What was once a mystery is now a wonderful revelation of newborn life. I would ask my colleagues that before they cast a vote on this measure, listen to that heartbeat. Look into the womb. Feel the kick of the baby's legs and arms. Before the abortionist sticks the scissors into the baby's skull, turn the baby. Look at that face and the fullness of life that resides in it. Feel the baby's body and the very essence of life. If you still have the courage, then insert the scissors. Collapse the brain, and take the life.

The Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I chair with Senator Collins, is a bipartisan coalition of Senators from the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic dedicated to improving the environmental quality and economic vitality of the region. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program is a vital program to our region. LIHEAP provides home energy assistance to some of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens, including families with children, the elderly, and disabled individuals. People in our region know that cold weather kills. Mr. President, the facts speak for themselves. According to the Centers for Disease Control, between 1979 and 1998, hypothermia claimed the lives of over 13,000 Americans, twice as many Americans than died due to excessive heat. Residential energy costs in the Northeast and Midwest are more expensive which means that families in the region spend a greater amount of their incomes on home heating. It also requires more energy to heat a home than to cool one. LIHEAP households in our region spend over twice as much to heat their homes in the winter than it costs to cool a home in the south in the summer. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, during the peak winter heating season, energy bills can frequently reach up to 30 percent of a low-income family's income, especially if they live in substandard housing. This winter, the average temperature in Rhode Island was in the low- 30s. Without heat, these temperatures are life-threatening. In my State, sweaters and blankets are not enough to keep you warm. If heating assistance is not available, low-income families, senior citizens and disable individuals living on fixed incomes make drastic choices, they go without food, prescription drugs and other basic necessities in order to maintain heat in their homes. On average, it cost $1,200 to heat a home in Rhode Island last year. Low-income families cannot afford these costs. LIHEAP provides vital assistance to keep the heat on for these households. In February, my home State of Rhode Island ran out of LIHEAP funding and had to close its program. I received phone calls from a number of senior citizens who were unable to heat their homes because they ran out of heating oil. To help low-income families address the runaway costs of home energy bills, we need greater funding for this program. This year, Senator Collins and I lead a bi-partisan letter supported by 37 Senators that requested $3 billion for the LIHEAP program in fiscal 2003. I will ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the letter in the Record, and I want to thank Senators Harkin and Specter for their strong and consistent support of this program. Senators Harkin and Specter increased LIHEAP funding by $300 million in fiscal year 2002. Unfortunately this was not enough to help States address the unmet need. During the winter of 2000/2001, the Nation experienced extraordinarily and unprecedented levels in energy costs along with colder winter temperatures. Many low-income families and senior citizens are still trying to pay off from the energy debt they incurred last winter. While energy prices are lower this year, they are not low by historic standards and the prices for natural gas and home heating oil remain at significant costs for many Americans. The recession is also an increasing need for assistance. There is something that President Bush can do immediately to help low-income households meet their energy needs. Congress appropriated $300 million in the FY2001 Supplemental Appropriations bill for emergency LIHEAP assistance. For incomprehensible reasons, the President has chosen not to release the emergency LIHEAP funding. And, the President's budget inexplicably requests $300 million less for this program in 2003. Leadership and action are urgently needed to help low- income working families and senior citizens, and I hope the President will take action to release the emergency funds. Next year, the Health, Education and Labor and Pensions Committee will begin reauthorizing the LIHEAP program. I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his support of this program. I look forward to working with him and my colleagues to improve the LIHEAP program and increase funding.","party":"N/A","Topic 1":0.155717873634302,"Topic 2":0.126732574569297,"Topic 3":0.0924304146447684,"Topic 4":0.533365223034607,"Topic 5":0.0917539141170255},{"id":"10720020047821","body":"We would pass it before she is recognized","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.071972166426224,"Topic 2":0.36119839012026,"Topic 3":0.289386028339767,"Topic 4":0.18935273498046,"Topic 5":0.0880906801332891},{"id":"10720010054639","body":"Is there objection?","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.183027073468541,"Topic 2":0.090469505517907,"Topic 3":0.296299767496807,"Topic 4":0.14570811196916,"Topic 5":0.284495541547585},{"id":"10720010051432","body":"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be authorized to meet during the session on the Senate on Thursday, July 11, 2002 at 2:30 p.m. to hold a hearing on implementing U.S. Policy in Sudan.

Everyone talks about my issue is more important, or that issue is more important. But the truth is, when we are talking about the future of America, that issue is education, because that is the one issue that not only helps us this week, this year, next year, but really secures our future when we are headed into the 21st century and the challenges we face. This group of young people in our schools today will determine the kind of future we are going to have. So many times I get perplexed when I have my colleagues come to this floor, and I really sense, number one, that they have not visited a school recently; or if they have been to a school, that they did not go into the classrooms; and if they went into a classroom, they probably did not pay attention to what they were seeing or listening to from the teacher, or they were not looking into the eyes of some of the very bright children who were in those classrooms struggling to learn in conditions, in many cases, that Members of this body would not want to be in every day. They are overcrowded, and in the summertime they are hot, and in the wintertime they may be cold. Or they are in a trailer outside, and if it is raining, they walk through the rain to get to the classroom, or walk through any kind of inclement weather. First, this evening, let me talk about some very positive things, some good things that are happening in our public schools. As this hour goes on, I will talk about more of them. Let me first talk about some schools in my district, something I know about, and in North Carolina. I had the occasion over the last couple of weeks, and I make an effort to visit schools about every week, but I went to a school down in part of my district, Anderson Creek Elementary, and visited with the principal, Ms. Cobb, and an awful lot of the teachers and students. They have a program where they encourage children to read. It is really a kindergarten through about fourth grade reading program. Some of the schools I am going to mention actually do it in the higher grades. She got those young people so excited about reading by giving them certificates and tee shirts, and getting the parents involved through kindergarten, that those youngsters in that school, and there are about roughly 700 elementary school students, over 545 of them read at least 100 books. They had read a total of over 155,000 books this year; probably more than that by now. When we talk about good things, those are the kinds of things that make a difference. Because if a youngster learns to read and they learn to do math and they learn to communicate, that will make a difference. They will be successful students. I went to North Harnett Elementary the same day, where the leading reader in that school had read 410 books. It is amazing to me that a youngster would read 410 books and still do his or her homework. At Anderson Creek, they had one student who read 545 books. The children in that school had read a substantial number. It is sort of contagious. These are good things happening in Harnett County. Lafayette Elementary, the same thing. They went in, had an assembly, and they honored the students. Their program was titled Reading Around the World, where they actually put flags of nations around the world about which the youngsters had read. They got involved. They had tee shirts and they got certificates, and they honored top readers. These are the things we do not hear a lot about, but we always hear people critical of those people who are giving so much time in the classroom who really are creative, innovative, and thinking about how do we make things better for children. Then I went to Cleveland Elementary School, a school in the community I grew up in. The same kind of thing: a very caring principal and assistant principal, with an awful lot of hard-working, focused teachers. They were doing the program not only in reading, but in a number of other areas, and they were giving out certificates. Children were really and truly getting ready to build a strong foundation for the future, things we were not doing 10 or 20 years ago. I went over to East Clayton Elementary School over near Clayton, and the same kind of thing: a very focused principal providing great leadership, and teachers who were caring, creative, and making a difference. I only mention these schools because they are representative not only of just schools in my congressional district or in my State of North Carolina, but I happen to think they are representative of teachers and students and principals and administrators all across this country. Do we have problems? Sure. Do we need to improve? Absolutely. But they are about making a difference. This is the way we improve it. I have learned a long time ago that if we want to improve education, we lay out a plan, we work with the people, and we give them encouragement. It is awful easy to be critical. It is a lot like a little poem I use many times, and I think my colleagues would benefit from that, because it reminds me of being an architect. It takes a long time to go to school to be an architect. It takes a number of years. But the last time I checked, if we want to hire somebody to tear a building down, we can put them in a machine and put a ball at the end of a chain and we can knock it down pretty quick. Too many times we have people who unfortunately are willing to tear down, but are not willing to help be architects. We not only need architects to build buildings, we need architects in our classrooms. We have them in teachers; we need more. Yes, we need resources to help train them better, because the needs for our teachers are changing every day. I think that is the key issue in education, is that we give encouragement where it is needed. Certainly, we give counsel when it is not working out. If we have people who are not doing the job, then we need to take appropriate action, like we would do in any other area. But we ought to acknowledge when our teachers and our administrators and people who work with our children every day are doing a good job. Let me just share with Members, if I may, before I get to some prepared remarks, I read an article recently that I want to just read some pieces out of. It is by Gerald Bracey, and it was in The Washington Post. I think it is right on target when we are talking about education. It says, ``Why do we scapegoat the schools?'' I could not help but think, there is a lot of truth in this. I think I know a little bit about this. I said to my colleagues when they came here, I served as State superintendent of schools of North Carolina for 8 years. That is an elective office in North Carolina, like the governor and some others. There is one thing I learned. We may not know all the answers of what to do, but I know some of the things that do not work. Sometimes that is worth an awful lot. Gerald Bracey made this point: ``There is no pleasing some people, even when they get what they want. So why do we keep listening to them? For more than 20 years now, people have been bashing our schools.'' He goes all the way back to the time when the Russians put up the Sputnik, and we got all carried away in this country and said our math and science programs are in shambles, our schools are failing us, our schools need to be fixed, so we put together a program. Lo and behold, with President Kennedy's focus and commitment, and yes, this Congress, the House and Senate put in resources behind it, and I emphasize, resources, and translated, that is money behind it, we put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. But Bracey goes on to say, we didn't say to the public schools, you are no longer in crisis, you have done a good job. You make this happen. Then all of a sudden, we walked along, and they did not get credit for what they had done. We stayed quiet. All of a sudden, after that happened, he said that there was no declaration that the crisis in education was over, and the question was raised, do pigs fly? Translated, that is that we did not give them the credit; it was assumed they had to do it. He goes on to talk about, again, he says, ``I don't mean to suggest, of course, that America's public schools are perfect. The dreary state of some urban and poor rural school systems is well documented.'' I would agree with that. He said, ``But I have been following the anguish over our competitive capabilities since the '83 report, and I've noticed the same pattern. In the early nineties, as the economy tanked and the recession set in, many variations of `Lousy schools are producing a lousy work force and it is killing us in the global market' could be heard, but those slackards somehow managed to turn things around. By early 1994, many publications featured banner headlines about the recovery that later became the longest sustained period of economic growth in the Nation's history. And then, `The American economy, back on top,' was the way that The New York Times summed up the turnaround in February of 1994.'' Well, did the public schools have anything to do with that? Were the people that were employed in those businesses all of a sudden better 2 years later than they were 2 years before? Did we give them any credit for that happening? No. They continued to be hammered. He goes on to say, ``Looking at a number of the different rankings of schools and school reports, the United States looked particularly bad in one DEF category: the difference in quality between rich and poor schools. We finished 42nd lower than any other developed nation, which is shameful for a rich nation.'' So if 26 nations had better schools, how did we wind up being number 2 in competitive ranking of all the nations in the world? The DEF used dozens of variables in many sectors, and the United States ranks well across the board. One important consideration is the brain drain factor. Our scientists and engineers stay here, earning us a top ranking in that category. Other nations of the world who send young people to the United States to be educated, and certainly we have received or we have been the beneficiary of that for a number of years, they come here and many of them stay in the United States, and they make their contributions here. We as a society and as a people have been beneficiaries of their coming to America and getting their educations here. It has made a difference. I only share this because I think this article is a good article for me to segue into the comments I want to make this evening, because I think there are some good things. There are a lot of good things about our public schools. I think the American public cares very deeply about our public schools. We have roughly 53 million young people in this country in the public schools of America. Depending on what State one is in, that may range from roughly 93 or 94 percent in North Carolina to where some States, maybe a little lower, we probably have 95 instead of 94, and some States less because they have more parochial schools. The bottom line is, the bulk of the students in this country are in the public school sector, and historically they have gotten a good education. The challenge we face today in the 21st century is a much different challenge than we faced 50 or even 100 years ago, or even 25 years ago, for that matter. The world is a different place. We are technology- driven, by and large. We want every child to be able to make it. We do not have the luxury that we had 30 or 40 years ago where we could educate the top 20 percent, the rest of them could get a job on the production line. Those jobs in industry, wherever it may be, or even on the farm, for that matter, wherever they work, are really tied to technology. Many of the jobs around this country and increasingly around the globe are tied to technology; and that is why we need our young people better educated today than ever in the history. And that is why we look to the public schools and we are challenging them. Parents are, rightly so, looking at their community. That is why when you see survey after survey, if you look at the rankings, and I have had occasion to follow them for a number of years now, by and large parents tend to rate the schools that their children attend fairly high. They usually get a B or higher for the schools their children attend. And if you look at schools, in general, they tend to get a much lower ranking. Why is that so? I think the reason is that parents and the people in that community are familiar with those schools where their children go. They know the teachers. They know what happens in that school, so they get a much higher ranking. They do not know about all these other schools. What they hear about these schools is general information that is shared, be it accurate or inaccurate, so they tend to process it. If they tell them schools are bad and they hear public officials continue to say it, they will say, My school is good. I think it has a lot to do with the same kind of ranking with Members in this body. They say Congress in general, we really do not have that high of numbers; but if you ask about a Member that represents in a district, he is a pretty good guy or lady. I know him. They represent us well. I think that is reflected in that as well. Let me move now to some of the issues I want to talk about, and I am joined now by some of my colleagues, and I will call on them in just a minute, the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois , who really has been a tremendous leader in education in this body. But I would like to begin tonight by talking about why education is such an urgent national issue, and it really is. Since September 11 we have all been heavily focused on the issues regarding our national security, and I think that is appropriate, and on homeland security specifically. And that focus is completely appropriate as we have become aware of threats to our security in this new era of terrorist attacks. I mean, if we pick up a newspaper, we read a magazine, we turn on the TV, it is in front of us. So it is appropriate we deal with it. But we make a huge mistake, I think, if we fail to recognize and act on the reality that increasing the investment in education is imperative but it is absolutely critical to our Nation's security. It is as important, maybe more important, but it is equally as important as protecting our borders, both in the immediate sense and in the long term. You know, it is a lot like a child developing. It is awful hard for a child to develop healthy if we do not feed them the proper food. And if you give them food to develop the bodies, we have to give them the right education and opportunities to develop their minds, to be a well- rounded person. In the 21st century, America's economic growth and prosperity depend more and more on a knowledge-based economy and on the skills of our people. And we have seen that over the last many years. Working Americans are beginning to understand that their level of earning is tied directly to their level of learning. Let me repeat that again. Their level of earning is directly tied to their level of learning. And it will be more so in the 21st century. And we really do not think about it; a lot of us as adults think of learning as academic being in the classroom. Let me remind my colleagues that all of us learn every day in the people we come in contact with, the interactions, the bulletins we read, whatever we do. It is things that we pick up. And it really perplexes me when I hear people talk about, and sometimes they do not think before they speak sometimes, they talk about how a student made little of this and a little of that. I used to go to civic clubs. I specifically remember one Rotary Club, and I will not call the name of where it was because somebody might be watching from that town. We had an eighth grade exit math exam for our students in North Carolina. I thought, I will have some fun. So I carried that math exam with me to the civic club. I will not even call the name of it. I handed it out. I said, I have read in this local paper how this exit exam is not even an eighth grade level. So I passed it out to the people who had come to lunch. Now, I was not so dumb as to not carry the answer sheet with me. I carried it with me. So I watched their faces as they were working on it. Finally as we got near the end of the meeting I said, if anybody wants to raise their hand and give me the answer, and I would read the question. And I could tell by looking at their face some of them had not done too good on getting their answers right. The point is we have some of the brightest young people in our public schools today we have ever had. But our challenge today in this body as we develop policy and across this country is to make sure that every child gets that opportunity, and we are trying. I want to talk about it as the evening goes on about the bill of No Child Left Behind and why it is important that, if we are going to do legislation, we have to put the resources behind it. An educated populace is also critical to the survival of a free people and the sustaining of our democracy. Our Nation's experiment with self-governance can only endure if our people know and understand their stake in its success. And I will talk more later about the long- term challenges we face in education, but I want to now talk about the immediate challenges we face in America's schools. And I think before I do that, though, I want to talk about some infrastructure needs; but before I do, let me turn to my colleague from Chicago, Illinois , who has been a champion for education in this body. But he has really been a fighter for young people since he has been here. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.435287374346475,"Topic 2":0.054167053583389,"Topic 3":0.219390414666504,"Topic 4":0.0744911414800744,"Topic 5":0.216664015923557},{"id":"10720020002197","body":"Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the hard work and amazing contributions of United States postal workers who since September 11, since the anthrax scare has continued to do yeoman work in delivering the mail without any sense of stoppage.

The second point that this bill addresses is incredible proliferation of soft money. I think it is fair to say there are thousands of people who are being forced or choosing to make campaign contributions of unlimited amounts to both political parties, and this is not for good government. Soft money was created to support political parties to encourage people to get the vote out and that will continue under Shays-Meehan. It was not intended to take over control. I just want to conclude by saying the amount of soft money was $86 million in 1992, $260 million in 1996; over half of a billion dollars in the year 2000, a half a billion dollars.

Pilots do work hard. I have commented to that effect on other occasions, and on other measures. Our problem is, looking at the Senate floor, we have two Senators, maybe three at the most. What really occurs is that we are addressing a ``fixed'' jury. In other words, 35 years ago when I came to the Senate, we did not have the luxury of television. So if you wanted to know what was going on, you had to come over on the floor. Invariably, there were always 20 to 30 Republican Senators in their cloakroom, and 20 to 30 Democrats in their cloakroom. If an issue was raised, you could make a point and come right out on the floor. Or if you agreed with a particular Senator, you could thank him for his observation. In a sense, we would learn from each other. We now have the TV everywhere. Incidentally, if you are watching it in your office and you find you want to raise a point, you come to the floor quickly; then you find out someone else has been waiting an hour, another Senator has been waiting a half hour, so your opportunity is totally missed. But the real point is, we do not listen to each other. The pilots have worked--he is dead right, they have worked this bill. And to my surprise, it has come up this afternoon. I have tried my very best to improve airline security since the terrorist attacks. As the chairman of the Commerce Committee, I got the best possible witnesses together, and we immediately passed out of the committee a bipartisan, unanimous airline security measure. We passed it out of the Senate 100 to 0. While we had the view in the Senate that airline security should be within the Justice Department in order to compromise and get things done, we went along with the House and kept it in the Transportation Department which proved to be, of course, a mistake in that we wasted now 6 or 7 months in confirming the man who took over, but was replaced in the particular role as head of transportation security. Without a much debate and without a report we just put his nomination up on the floor and we voted to have him confirmed so he could get off to a running start. In any event, we made a mistake. I realize we were behind the curve, and we had a some unnecessary requirements with respect to airline security and they were going in the wrong direction in some instances. Let me say categorically, I am pleased Admiral Loy, the Commandant of the Coast Guard--we had the Coast Guard authorization in our particular committee, so we worked closely with Admiral Loy on Coast Guard and seaport security. We had field hearings together, as well as within the Senate. He is very realistic, very attune, an expert, very professional, very much experienced on security. He had not taken over for very long before the August break. I did not demand that he respond to questions for his nomination, but I gave him our questions in a 2-page letter and said: Work over August and we will have a hearing on this security measure, the guns. I am constantly asked by the press about this issue, and we would be delighted to vote on guns in the cockpit, we would be delighted to vote in the committee. We had this hearing scheduled. I talked to Admiral Loy only yesterday. He has answered our letter, and he is ready to go next Tuesday. He has been doing just the right kind of work, getting around and conferring with the airport managers and getting everybody working together. Not unlike the former occupant of this desk who greatly impressed me, Senator Robert Kennedy. He had never been in the courtroom, but when he was selected as the Attorney General of the United States, he was the first Attorney General to go around and shake hands with the 32,000 in the Justice Department at that time. You have to get your team working together. Admiral Loy has done that. But I say it is a fixed jury because the pilots, as the Senator from New Hampshire has pointed out, have been working this issue. We all have many responsibilities. I just have not had the opportunity to bring up the facts and test what we already have. The Senator from California said: ``And since we know this, and since we know that,'' why have any further tests? I could not agree with the distinguished Senator from California any more. We do know. How do we know? We know from the best of the best. There is one airline that is under the gun. That is the Israeli airline, El Al. In fact, they have been so successful in preventing hijacking that they do not even have attempted hijackings, as far as we know. They just go after the ticket counter itself, as they did in Los Angeles, and shoot it up and kill those people there. But knowing El Al is the most under-the-gun airline, we had the privilege of talking to a gentleman, the chief pilot of El Al, in September of last year. It was just about a year ago, slightly less than a year. He said: ``Senator, what you want to do is get a secure door to the cockpit. That is the last line of defense. Not a gun--the last line of defense is that secure door. And that door is never, ever to be opened in flight.'' Once the door is secure and if there is any disturbance whatsoever in the cabin, they go immediately to the ground and law enforcement meets them there. The chief pilot of El Al emphasized--I will never forget it--he said: ``Senator, they can be assaulting my wife in the cabin. I do not open that door.'' And for 30 years they have not had a hijacking. We have a test, and that is why I am on the floor of the Senate trying to make sense out of this bad mistake that is about to be made because there is one thing you do not want to do, and that is put weaponry on the plane itself. In fact, the marshals pointing their guns recently on that Delta flight going into Philadelphia--wrong. You don't point your gun, and law enforcement and gun safety dictate that, unless you intend to use it. Anybody should know that. So even our marshals need better training already. But be that as it may, for 30 years now they have not had a hijacking on El Al Airlines. We have had a test and we know it. The trouble is, this has been worked politically. I know how the system works. I look around and I look for the measures and speakers who will talk in support of it. I find out that Senators who first were inclined to vote with me and listen and understand the problem, they have gone. I know the White House position is they should not have them. It has been announced and reaffirmed that they do not want pilots to carry guns in the cockpit. But you don't see anybody out here defending President Bush and the policy of this administration. More to the point, I could talk all day long, or talk into next week and just hold the floor. I hope we can work out a compromise with respect to keeping the door closed. But let me read a letter, which is new to me. It was less than an hour ago when I had an appointment with Mr. Leo Mullin, the chief executive officer of Delta Airlines down in Atlanta, down in my backyard. Mr. Mullin was there and mentions the discussion we had about the economic travails of air transport in America. He said: I haven't led anybody. I can't find anybody behind me. I am not a leader unless they let my staff vote. I think they would go along with me. But I haven't been able to find a Senator to go with me, and we have called the White House. You can rest for a while. Don't worry about it because I am going to take a little time and give you all some rest. I know I am doing the Lord's work. This letter is dated today. Divert right here. I ask unanimous consent the letter in its entirety be printed in the Record.

I have to say in the 8 years I have been here, at no time has it been more painful for me to listen to partisan rhetoric associated with an issue than has been the case in this debate. The issue of corporate governance is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue; it is not the fault of one administration or another. Certainly the problems arose and occurred during the previous administration, but I do not blame the previous administration, any more than I blame this administration. We will not solve these problems, we will not address these problems proactively and effectively, by pointing fingers at each other and trying to accuse each other and make political hay out of a situation that demands calm, pragmatic and cooperative work on the part of everybody in this body to come up with a solution that restores confidence and creates growth and begins the process of growth again in our economy. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the work that has been done by our President and the speech that he made earlier this week in New York City. I want to pay particular attention to the exhaustive hearings that have been held by both the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection over the past 6 months. Some of these hearings were held well before the crisis erupted to the point where it is today and may have in their content given regulators significant assistance and information and a prodding, quite honestly, to move forward and to make changes that may be way overdue. Let me just say from the outset that the problem we face in corporate America is that there are a few very bad apples that have broken the law, and, as our distinguished committee chairman has said on a number of different occasions, these individuals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and they should be sent to jail, just like any other common criminal in this country. There is no difference between stealing money from investors and robbing a bank and stealing money or shoplifting in a store, except it is more serious, and they ought to go to jail for it. Secondly, as I alluded to in the beginning of my comments, the solution to this problem should be bipartisan, bipartisan. The more we talk about whether it is a Republican's fault or a Democrat's fault, the harder it is going to be to come to a good, quick, effective solution, and the only people who are going to suffer from that are going to be consumers, investors, retirees, parents and families. So it is time we got together and cut out this partisan discussion. Thirdly, I think we should direct regulators to move expeditiously to clean up the problems that we face and provide recommendations, which we have done in two pieces of legislation, one that was marked up by the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection yesterday and another one passed earlier by the committee. But what we should not do, in my opinion, is put into statute what should be done by regulators, because when you place ideas into statute, they are there forever, effectively, for a long time, and conditions in the financial world change and you have to have flexibility to deal with problems as they arise and change things over time. We run the risk by forcing regulators to do things that we want or by passing laws that set regulations in statute that we will create problems in the economy that were unintended. Thirdly, we should be very careful not to stifle capitalism in this country, that we should not stifle the ability of the hundreds of thousands of honest entrepreneurs in this country and hard-working Americans who are trying to make a go of it and are doing it honestly. We do not want to turn every CPA in this country into a Federal bureaucrat. We do not want to have chief financial officers and executives answerable to the Federal Government instead of to their shareholders and to their boards of directors. We want to have a system of regulations in place that is flexible, accountable, transparent; no more, no less. The fact is, we cannot in Congress legislate honesty. We never have and we never will. But we can work together as Republicans and Democrats to assure that the rule of law applies to all and that corporate America is held accountable. If we do this, we will get out of this problem quickly and we will look at a bright and prosperous period of economic growth in the years to come.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.217946333384515,"Topic 2":0.23321970102629,"Topic 3":0.150867088647725,"Topic 4":0.0969391019936177,"Topic 5":0.301027774947853},{"id":"10720010022697","body":"Mr. Speaker, one year ago on September 11, our country suffered unexpected and unjustified attacks that killed and injured innocent people from many nations of the world. While the attacks occurred in the city of New York, a peaceful field in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon in Virginia, the effects of terrorism were felt in every corner of America and throughout the world of nations that shared our sorrow. The resulting war on terrorism has called together the people of America to unite behind a commitment to defend our homeland and preserve our way of life against all enemies of freedom and liberty. In doing so, America has witnessed a heartening resurgence of patriotism, a deep appreciation for the ordinary heroes among us, a fervent call to prayer, and a thankful devotion to the simple blessings of family, community, faith and friendship. We are indeed a blessed people, committed to liberty for individuals and nations everywhere, but mindful that freedom too often comes with great sacrifice. Who can doubt our American faithfulness and resolve as we grieve for those who lost life on September 11, applaud the brave government servants and military might of our great nation, strive for economic stability and quietly pray for a peaceful world free of tyrants and violence. The United States is no stranger to evil--our forefathers have overcome it through 225 years of proud but difficult history. The challenge for this and future generations will be to never succumb to the temptation of withdrawing from our national obligation to resist evil and fight for freedom for future generations of Americans. The war against terrorism, memorialized in those who died one year ago, is only the latest test of our national resolve.

The Chemical Security Act, S. 1602, which I cosponsored, would require ``high priority'' facilities to improve security and reduce hazards. The bipartisan and strong support for this issue was demonstrated last July when the bill unanimously passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Across the country, thousands of industrial facilities use dangerous chemicals in amounts that could endanger nearby communities if the facilities were attacked by terrorists. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Planning program, there are 123 facilities where a release of chemicals could threaten more than 1 million people. There are also more than 700 facilities from which a chemical release could threaten more than 100,000 residential neighbors. Yet there is no Federal security standard for chemical facilities, no Federal guidelines on facility proximity to neighboring communities, and no Federal agency overseeing the operations and safety of these facilities. This bill is not intended to address chemical accidents. The Clean Air Act already provides existing authority. However, a review of the chemical accident data provides clear insight into the dangers associated with chemical releases from these facilities. Federal data suggests that in 1998 there were almost 50,000 incidents--fires, spills and explosions--over 100 deaths, and nearly 5,000 injuries, related to chemical industrial accidents in the United States. Some analysts suggest that for each catastrophic chemical accident that causes a fatality, there are 300 recordable incidents and 30,000 near misses. One estimate suggests that U.S. chemical accidents cost about $15 billion a year. In 1999, Congress required the Department of Justice to issue, within 3 years, a report to Congress on the vulnerability of chemical facilities to criminal and terrorist activity. For over a year, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has been asking for this report. Beyond a very thin and useless preliminary draft, the administration has not complied with this requirement of the Clean Air Act amendments. The Justice Department claims that funding constraints have impacted their work. This excuse is completely unacceptable, as is the administration's delay in addressing what may be this Nation's biggest terrorist vulnerability. Three years ago, Congress recognized the potential risks to our Nation's chemical security. Not 1 more year or month should pass with this issue unresolved. Press reports highlight the public's frustration. In September, Newsweek reported a failing grade to the Federal Government in protecting chemical plants and other hazardous materials. I believe the article accurately described the forces blocking action: ``industry lobbyists and infighting among a multitude of government agencies trying to defend their turf have combined to hold Ridge's office and the Environmental Protection Agency at bay.'' I ask my colleague to step beyond bureaucratic delays and special interest pressures to think of the families that could be impacted by our inaction here today. We must act on this issue as soon as possible.

Voter qualification is generally a power the Constitution leaves within the prerogative of the States. The Constitution grants States broad power to determine voter qualification. It is highly doubtful that Congress has constitutional authority to pass legislation preempting the states with regard to this issue. The Ford/Carter Commission agrees with this assessment. The Commission concluded, ``we doubt that Congress has the constitutional power to legislate a federal prescription'' on States prohibiting felons from voting. In 1974 the Supreme Court held that convicted felons do not have a fundamental right to vote, and that excluding convicted felons from voting does not violate the Constitution. Federal courts have consistently dismissed lawsuits aimed at letting prisoners vote. One court even concluded that the facial validity of felon voting restrictions may be ``absolute.'' Only two States do not impose restrictions on the voting rights of felons. In fourteen States, felons convicted of a crime may lose the right to vote for life. Congress should not interpose itself between the States and their people. As the Ford/Carter Commission said in their report: This proposed amendment frankly, should fail on the merits. When a person is convicted of a felony, that person should lose their right to vote. Convicted felons have been denied various privileges granted to other citizens going all the way back to ancient Rome and Greece. Voting is a privilege; a privilege properly exercised at the voting booth, not from a prison cell. States have a significant interest in reserving the vote for those who have abided by the social contract that forms the foundation of a representative democracy. We are talking about rapists, murderers, robbers, and even terrorists or spies. Do we want to see convicted terrorists who seek to destroy this country voting in elections? Do we want to see convicted spies who cause great damage to this country voting in elections? Do we want to see ``jailhouse blocs'' banding together to oust sheriffs and government officials who are tough on crime? Those who break our laws should not have a voice in electing those who make and enforce our laws. Those who break our laws should not dilute the vote of law-abiding citizens. Fundamentally, Mr. President, as a former Governor yourself, this is a decision made in each State by the Governor, as to whether or not to restore the rights of convicted felons. But in any event, it seems to me a Federal prescription in this area, just as the Ford/Carter Commission concluded, is not appropriate. So I hope we will not seek to preempt this area of State law in the course of our action on election reform legislation. Mr. President, I know also Senator Sessions wishes to speak on this issue. I think he will be here shortly.

Not a university at that time, it was Arkansas AM&amp;N College. I recall having $20 in my pocket, scared as I could possibly be, having never been away from home that much; but I also remember being able to go and register on credit. I also recall being able to purchase books and borrow them with virtually no money. Then as time went on, I have six brothers and sisters who also attended the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, four nieces and nephews. Then I look around in my office in terms of people to work with and for me, there are seven individuals who work with me who have attended Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Wilberforce, Morehouse, Howard, UAPB, Jackson State. The reality is that for thousands and thousands of individuals, without these institutions being available, well equipped, ready, prepared, many of the individuals who have managed to rise above the individuality of their circumstances would have never been able to do so. So I commend my colleague for introducing the resolution. I also share the comments of my colleague from New York who suggests that the best way to pay tribute to these institutions is to make sure they have adequate resources, that they are adequately funded, that there are resources to rebuild, in some instances, their infrastructures. Some of them I have visited their campuses, and they are seriously in need of repair. Some of them have virtually no equipment. Mr. Speaker, as we pay tribute, the best way to do that is to make sure that these institutions are able to continue to grow, to develop, to thrive, and provide the opportunity for the thousands and thousands of students who otherwise would not be able to make it. Mr. Speaker I rise in support of H. Res. 523, Recognizing the Contributions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. There are about 105 historically black colleges and universities in the United States--the first being Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, which was founded in 1837. This measure commends the Nation's historically black colleges and universities for their commitment to educating all students, including low-income and educationally disadvantaged students, and recognizes the significance of title III of the Higher Education Act , which strengthens the academic quality, management and financial stability of historically Black higher-education institutions. Also, the Black land-grant institutions in which the U.S. Congress had to pass a second Morrill Act in 1890 designed to provide equal educational opportunities for Black students who had been denied admission to their States' original 1862 land-grant universities. The 1890 institutions are a subset of the HBCUs whose mission is teaching, research, and extension and the continual education of young men and women to be self-sufficient. Harry Truman, the 33rd President of the United States of America said, ``We have to make it possible for every person to develop himself to the extent of his capacity and will, and no barriers should stand in the way; not for his or her sake, but for the sake of all of us.'' The one true measure of a nation's success is its ability to engage all of its citizens in the ever changing and transformation of a technology-based global economy. Cultural diversity, acceptance of differences, equal opportunity, shared economic prosperity--the ideals of the American way--must shift from being desired national objectives, to being absolutely crucial ones if the country wants to continue to be the most powerful, wealthiest, and freest nation in the world. To accomplish these goals America must face and overcome the tremendous task of educating all segments of its population. No group's educational potential can be neglected in this competitive global arena. The cost of ignorance is too great to ignore, neglect, and accept in order to build a stronger, and wealthier nation, otherwise to do so would deprive the economy of critical human resources and to incur costs to society--the costs of supporting those not capable of earning a living wage. Many African-American young people find themselves at a disadvantage by being victims of poverty and other social ills in their attempt to better themselves by seeking a higher education. Fortunately, the Nation has in place a network of institutions. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs. Traditionally, the predominantly Black institutions have attracted students mainly from the Black community. In the past, much of the existence and origin of HBCUs can be attributed to the Civil War between April 1861 to April 1865 which was the single most important factor leading to the creation of conditions favorable for the establishment, growth, and development of educational institutions for the Negro in southern States. The end of the war marked the close of an era of 246 years when the Negro in the South was in slavery--an era when in several southern States it was a crime to provide education or training in a useful trade or profession to a Negro. After the Civil War the men of the 62nd and 65th U.S. Missouri Regiment of Colored Infantry from the Union Army contributed $6,380 to establish Lincoln University of Missouri in 1866, one of the oldest predominately Black landgrant institutions. These young brave veterans of war wanted to develop an institution with a purpose to address poor Black students having access to an education. The committed founders of Lincoln initiated a national desire among churches, citizen groups, individuals, and State legislatures to develop and build educational institutions for their students to have access to quality affordable education and to address racial segregation in southern States. I am a graduate of the Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, which is a 1890 land-grant institution known today as University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. The HBCUs constitute some of the largest and most prestigious institutions of higher education in the nation. Several of the 1890s offer doctoral degrees and/or professional degrees in engineering, food science, toxicology, environmental science, and other areas of national need. Six public HBCUs produce nearly 20 percent of African-American bachelor degree recipients in engineering and the 1890s graduate over 80 percent of all Black recipients of bachelor degrees in agricultural sciences. Tuskegee University alone has trained more than 80 percent of the Nation's African-American veterinarians. These universities have been in the forefront of educating youth-at-risk, producing research vital to the quality of life and the environment, and addressing the social and economic needs of inner cities and rural communities. The HBCUs contributions must be commended because they with limited funding and resources have done an outstanding job and have made significant improvements in the range and level of academic performance and research programs. Our HBCUs must have increase funding to continue to serve the at-risk youth, low-income, and disadvantaged students in our country. After all, ``a mind is a terrible thing to waste.'' Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 523, Recognizing the Contributions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.215293021049089,"Topic 2":0.32043570711419,"Topic 3":0.125582630286681,"Topic 4":0.165601979701865,"Topic 5":0.173086661848174},{"id":"10720020007040","body":"Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I do not intend to oppose the gentleman's amendment. Actually, I think it is quite appropriate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act does regulate the practices of American businesses doing business abroad. It requires them to keep accurate books, records and accounts. It requires issuers to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission to maintain a responsible and internal accounting control system, and it prohibits bribery by American corporations of foreign officials. In the way of background, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was a U.S. initiative and we have tried very hard, through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Europe, OECD, to have other countries adopt similar kinds of national legislation. Until recently, many of our west European export competitors have actually permitted their corporations to have their bribes as tax deductible, incredible as that may seem. We have recently had positive action by many of these countries in that respect, but now the proof is in the pudding. That is to say, will they, in fact, have enforcement to make sure that no such bribery is not encouraged or permitted under their tax codes. In any case, the gentleman's amendment, I think, is highly appropriate. This kind of information should be made available and, in fact, generated, if necessary, within the Export-Import Bank. And it is my expectation that as a result of having that information and being encouraged to give it careful consideration the Ex-Im Bank will be able to avoid providing any kind of transaction assistance to an American firm that would be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Mr Chairman, my hope is that in fact something like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be applied internationally by actions of national legislative bodies.

I, too, wish to add my words of gratitude for the work that has been done on this bipartisan, comprehensive bioterrorism legislation. Under the leadership of Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Gregg, and Senator Frist, as well as a number of others of our colleagues, we are about to pass legislation that I think will make a significant difference in the health, safety, and preparedness of our Nation. Americans know we cannot wait for another bioterrorism incident such as the one we suffered last fall with respect to the anthrax attacks before we take action to protect ourselves. This bill contains a number of critical provisions that will improve national, State, and local preparedness. The authorization of a national stockpile of vaccines, antibiotics, and other drugs necessary in the case of an outbreak or other incident is absolutely essential. Furthermore, the emphasis on public health is long overdue, as Senator Frist so eloquently stated. This bill will invest over $1 billion in grants to our States to assure the adequate planning that is necessary to improve State and local public health system preparedness. I know all of us were surprised when we learned that many public health offices were more in the early 20th century with respect to their equipment and communications capability than in the early 21st century. They didn't have fax machines or e-mail capabilities. One of the problems we encountered with respect to our efforts to get ahead of the anthrax outbreaks and attacks was, in fact, the inability to communicate at different levels of government. The underinvestment in our public health infrastructure has been unacceptable. Now we are about to reverse it. This is long overdue and to be applauded. I also appreciate the bill authorizing $520 million to equip hospitals to respond to bioterrorism. After 9-11, when we had our hospitals on alert to try to take care of what we at the time thought would be thousands of injured people-- unfortunately, it turned out to be thousands of deaths and relatively few people who were injured--we found we were not prepared because we could not perform many of the functions that were necessary, not only to respond to the attacks but the aftermath. For example, many of the first responders went, after their duties at the Ground Zero site, to be decontaminated. There was no decontamination system. Many ended up at our hospitals in New York and were in very cramped and totally insufficient situations to try to decontaminate them before they went back to Ground Zero. That is just one example of what we determined was absolutely unacceptable, given the threats we currently face. So we will be providing training and other provisions to promote the development and production of treatments and what is necessary for our hospitals to be prepared. I also applaud the inclusion of strong provisions to safeguard our food supply and to provide for the protection of our children. We are finally coming into the recognition that we have not protected our food supply, now that we are in a global marketplace, the way we need to. These provisions that are included are ones that I and others have long believed were absolutely essential to establishing a registration system for food manufacturers, to give the FDA records inspection authority to trace back investigations, to provide for prior notice of imported food, to allow the cross-utilization of inspectors-- both from USDA and FDA--to provide grants for surveillance and protection, and to improve the surveillance of diseases affecting both animals and humans. I am very pleased, too, that this bill contains provisions I introduced in legislation, along with Senator Dodd and Congresswoman Slaughter from New York, to address the special needs of children. We know children have special vulnerabilities, and we also know biological and chemical agents can have a particularly bad and different effect on children because children are lower to the ground where we have gases that are dense and inert. We have other challenges in dealing with what happens to our children dealing with a bioterrorism attack. We have therefore established a national advisory commission on children and bioterrorism, and we will do much more to try to provide guidance on how best to protect our children. I also applaud the provision of $100 million to keep Plum Island, off the coast of New York, at its current biosecurity level and to modernize and improve the security of the facilities. Also, I think it is essential we are adding to our security at water systems and expanding the availability of potassium iodide for communities near nuclear powerplants, such as Indian Point near where I live. While we have taken such strong steps related to bioterrorism and children and food security and water security, I do have to express a disappointment that we were unable to include the codification of the pediatric rule that would require the testing of drugs that might be prescribed for our children. Senators Dodd and DeWine and I have introduced legislation to bring this about. Unfortunately, we were unable to attain support to have it included. But we will be taking steps, through a markup at the committee level and then with legislation, to try to ensure that the drug manufacturers to whom we have given access to an improved streamlined drug approval process-- which we all support--also will be assuring us that the drugs needed by our children are safe and properly labeled. This is a very good bill. There obviously are some features that should be included to make us stronger in the future, but I applaud my colleagues, and particularly those who shepherded it through the conference, for making us, today, safer than we would have been otherwise.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.211132431683766,"Topic 2":0.0960687045455557,"Topic 3":0.222696941535053,"Topic 4":0.0833078000648006,"Topic 5":0.386794122170825},{"id":"10720010052932","body":"Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``CLEAN- UP Meth Act,'' a bill to address illegal and environmentally disastrous methamphetamine production. I am pleased to submit this bill on behalf of myself, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Senator Kohl. Essentially, this bill would help our Federal, State and local governments combat methamphetamine on a number of levels, from production to clean-up, prosecution to prevention. The legislation would accomplish this with two key components: First, the bill would allocate $125 million for important training and cleanup efforts, including training local law enforcement to effectively clean up meth lab and dump sites. And second, we would make it much harder for meth dealers to get the precursor pseudoephedrine products necessary to make this illegal drug. Once predominantly found in the American Southwest, methamphetamine's presence now stretches from coast to coast. Once predominantly found in rural areas, its harmful effects now extend from our smallest towns to our biggest cities. For instance, the number of clandestine meth labs discovered in North Carolina has doubled every year for the past four years. In New Orleans, police in the Jefferson district seized a total of 828 grams of methamphetamine in all of the year 2000. Last year, they seized more than ten times that amount, 9,003 grams, with a street value of more than $1 million. I'm sorry to say that my home State of California has been referred to as the ``Colombia of meth production.'' In fact, our State is known as the ``source country'' for the drug, producing roughly 80 percent of the Nation's methamphetamine supply. According to the DEA, 1,847 clandestine meth labs were found last year in California alone. Each of these 1,847 labs in California, and each of the labs scattered around this Nation near schools, on farms, in trailer parks and in quiet suburban neighborhoods, creates a whole host of dangers and toxic waste. The actual production of methamphetamine is harmful in a number of ways. First, the hazardous chemicals used in meth production are toxic, and long-term exposure is damaging. Furthermore, the materials can also be explosive and dangerous. Production using these volatile materials has resulted in countless accidents, houses and even apartment buildings burned to the ground, explosions that scatter chemicals and flames, and chemical reactions that cause untold damage to the individuals involved in meth production or simply living in the same household, individuals that, too often, include children. Meth production also poses risks to the health of the surrounding public and environment. According to the National Drug Intelligence Center, NDIC, for every pound of meth produced, five to seven pounds of hazardous waste results from the production as well. Meth producers dump this waste anywhere and everywhere, from nearby ditches to public lands, from pits dug in the middle of a farm to rivers and lakes. One private contractor hired to clean up meth-related hazardous dump sites in California responded to more than 500 calls in 2000 alone. And one of those dump sites was located along the banks of the California Aqueduct, which is a direct source of water for Los Angeles. NDIC investigators have found also found toxic chemicals discarded into household drains and storm drains. And the precursors used to make meth, and the toxic byproducts, may last for years in the soil. Decontaminating these sites is what makes clean-up so expensive, with costs ranging from $5,000 to $150,000 per site. State police in Baltimore, MD claim that its costs taxpayers nearly $75,000 each time a meth lab must be cleaned up. According to the DEA, that agency spent more than $22 million cleaning up 6,609 labs nationwide. These extraordinary costs simply cannot be maintained on the local level without Federal support. These costs are proof of why Federal funding for such valuable efforts is necessary. So the first thing this legislation would do is help law enforcement as well as the public pay these important costs, by providing millions to help clean-up labs and train law enforcement authorities to properly and safety do this important work. Specifically, the CLEAN-UP Meth bill would provide: $15 million for clean-up and remediation of meth contaminated lands managed by the Departments of Agriculture or Interior; $15 million for Department of Agriculture grants to State and local governments and to private persons to clean up meth contaminated lands; $20 million for OSHA grants to local law enforcement agencies for training and equipment for the safe identification, handling, clean-up and disposal of meth labs; and $10 million for Department of Labor grants to local law enforcement agencies to help them comply with Federal laws regarding cleanup and disposal of meth labs. Second, this legislation includes resources to help State and local officials prosecute meth offenses, educate the public, and study the effects of meth use. Methamphetamine is so prevalent partly because it is simple to make and is profitable. Producers of meth range from people with advanced chemistry degrees to those who are self-taught. Recipes are easily available in books as well as over the Internet. The drug does not have to be smuggled in across secured international borders. Fifty percent of the Nation's consumed methamphetamine is produced right here in our country. In fact, the basic ingredients can be found in your local pharmacy. These relatively inexpensive materials can be used to create a drug that fetches much higher prices. For example, ounce quantities are worth between $1,500 and $2,000 and can be sold to individual users for about $100 a gram in crystallized powder form that can be smoked, snorted, swallowed or turned into liquid and injected. According to the Office of National drug Control Policy, ONDCP, methamphetamine users spent nearly $6 billion on the drug in 1999. Methamphetamine is also highly addictive. Known on the street as crank, speed, ice and zip, methamphetamine is cheaper than cocaine, more addictive than crack and causes more brain damage than heroin or alcohol. A single dose of this ``poor man's cocaine'' can keep a person awake for three to four days at a time and has been associated with paranoia and often violence. In California's Central Valley, methamphetamine has become the drug of choice and a principal cause of crime. I firmly believe that law enforcement officials cannot effectively fight this drug and its harmful effects unless we provide them with the proper resources. Already this year, police in Oklahoma City have seized 115 meth labs. Law enforcement officials there have attributed these seizures to the support from Federal grants. Keith Cain, a sheriff in Daviess County, KY also claims that Federal funding has proved to be crucial to the war against meth. According to Cain, ``Without that money, we would not have been able to be as proactive as we've been.'' Last year, the federally funded Central Valley High-Intensity Drug Trafficking project to restrict the supply of the chemical agents used in making the deadly drug was showing impressive results. A team of specialists from local drug units, the California Highway Patrol, DEA and FBI averaged one bust a week of the clandestine ``super labs'' that had made the Central Valley the national center for the production of methamphetamine. These triumphs were the direct result of federal funding and proof that allocating Federal resources is imperative to progress. However, since September 11, agents have been removed from the project and transferred to anti-terrorism work. The lack of drug enforcement resources has created a strain on the project and threatens the progress it has had combating methamphetamine. It would be a tragedy to California and the country if we lost all of the progress this program and others like it have made in the war on meth simply due to a lack of resources. Programs like this one have proven to be effective and need our continued support. Our bill would provide: $20 million for training of State and local prosecutors and law enforcement agents for prosecution of meth offenses, $5 million of which will be dedicated for rural communities and $2 million to reimburse the DEA for existing training programs; $10 million additional for training at the DEA's Clandestine Laboratory Training Facility in Quantico, VA; $2 million for the Department of Justice for the collection, aggregation and dissemination of meth lab seizure stats by the El Paso Intelligence Center, EPIC. Third, we address the problems of our children. Raids and seizures of clandestine meth labs have been instrumental to the war on meth and have uncovered a number of alarming issues, but none more troubling than the effect meth production has on the children of meth dealers and their friends. Drug rings and meth trafficking organizations found throughout the American West have been linked to Mexican drug traffickers as well as white supremacist groups. Last year, for instance, law enforcement authorities in Los Angeles County uncovered a sophisticated meth trafficking ring that includes suspects with tattoos of Nazi swastikas and belong to a local gang called the ``Untouchables.'' During police raids of their meth labs and headquarters, agents seized nearly $500,000 in cash and more than 100 high-powered weapons, including assault rifles and a grenade launcher. Earlier this year, Central Valley investigators raided a methamphetamine super-lab in a farmhouse on the outskirts on Merced, CA. Inside, investigators found vats of toxic chemicals, large supplies of pseudoephedrine used in producing meth and three illegal firearms. Yet, the most disturbing part of this story is that while the manufacturers were engaged in the potentially explosive process of extracting pure methamphetamine, four small children watched television in the next room. The children were taken to a local hospital and tested positive for methamphetamine contamination. I would like to say that this is a rare case. However, this story is no exception. In 2001, 1,989 children were found in clandestine meth labs, materials storage sites and dump sites across the country. The CLEAN-UP Meth Act would provide $2.5 million for grants to states for treatment of children suffering adverse health impacts from meth- related exposure. The bill also includes $20 million for the development of anti- methamphetamine education programs in our nation's schools. Informing and educating our children on the dangers of this drug is the first step in reducing the number of new users of methamphetamine. In addition to the funding provisions of the bill, which were introduced by Representative Ose in the House, this legislation also contains language to close the ``Blister Pack Loophole'' in current law, which currently allows meth dealers to purchase unlimited quantities of pseudoephedrine products, generally cold and sinus medication, as long as it is packaged in blister packs, those tin foil and plastic packages most of us buy these days, which require that each pill be separate rather than simply poured into a bottle. Our current law limits retail sales of bottled pseudoephedrine to just 9 grams, because we found several years ago that meth dealers would go into a pharmacy, a Costco or other large store, sweep the shelves clean of cold medicine, bring the bottles back to the lab, cut off the tops of the bottles without even bothering to unscrew the caps instead, and pour the pills out as the first step to making meth. When we passed the 9 gram threshold, and before that the 24-gram threshold, for bottled pills, I made the case that if limits were placed on bottles only, meth dealers would simply start buying blister- packed pills instead. At the time, some argued that blister packs were simply too unwieldy for meth manufacturers to bother with, the process of popping individual pills out of each blister would be too time consuming. But we had evidence from California that dealers were already using these blister packs, so as a compromise we asked the DEA to conduct a nationwide study of whether blister packs posed a problem. Well, guess what, they do. According to the report we requested from the DEA, which was finalized late last year, blister packaged pseudoephedrine products seized at clandestine methamphetamine laboratories and other locations, such as dumpsites, have involved seizures of over a million tablets. The seizure of so many blister packaged pseudoephedrine products shows convincingly that blister packaging is not a deterrent to ordinary, over-the-counter pseudoephedrine use in clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. Indeed, the report even includes information about automated machines whose sole purpose is to remove pills from blister packs on a massive scale. These machines have been found in meth labs, along with hundreds, even thousands, of empty blister packs. So clearly, what we argued in 1999, and in 1996, is true. Meth manufacturers are using blister packs, and something must be done to stop them as best we can. In order to address this problem, DEA recommended in the report it released late last year that the blister pack loophole be closed, and that the current retail sales limit of 9 grams for bottled pseudoephedrine be extended to blister packed products as well. And that is what this bill would do. The meth problem is not just a California problem, or a New York problem, or even an Iowa problem. The meth problem is a national problem, with tragic consequences across this great country. Without a continuing, nationwide, relentless effort on the part of the Federal Government, this problem will continue to grow and to infect our children and our communities with the scourge of methamphetamine production and use. I believe DEA Director Hutchinson put it best this spring when he argued in support of Federal efforts to crack down on meth. ``It clearly impacts every one of our districts, every segment of our society and every age group.'' I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and join the latest step towards progress in our war against methamphetamine.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.0999490395018387,"Topic 2":0.218489575471374,"Topic 3":0.31592892137112,"Topic 4":0.235030067331404,"Topic 5":0.130602396324263},{"id":"10720010019225","body":"Mr. Speaker, before I recognize my final speaker, I would ask the Speaker to outline the order in which the closing statements will take place.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.147719790539928,"Topic 2":0.105945244074299,"Topic 3":0.430119741867765,"Topic 4":0.207154634284203,"Topic 5":0.109060589233805},{"id":"10720020065724","body":"Madam President, last year when my beloved little dog Billy passed away, many people came to me to express their condolences. It was like losing one of the family. My wife and I have shed many tears over little Billy. There is never a day that I don't pass his little box of ashes that is sitting up in my bedroom, never a day that I don't touch that little box and think of little Billy. He has been with us 15 years. We have a new dog now, one which is a very sweet little female dog. She is a lap dog. She is a Shi Tzu, a dog that came out of Tibet. It was bred to be a lap dog in the palace, extremely friendly, knows no person is not a friend. She just smothers my wife's face with kisses-- and mine, too. So we love her. But I said to Erma the other night: Erma, if Billy could come back tomorrow, would he still be No. 1? And both she and I said yes; even though we love this little dog, the little dog we have now, the female--she is called Trouble; I think my wife saw me coming when she named the little dog Trouble. I said to Erma, if Billy came back tonight, would he still be No. 1, and she said yes. And we both agreed that Billy would still be No. 1. Last year, when our beloved dog Billy Byrd passed away, many people came to me to express their condolences. But one who really, really touched me was a big, hulking Navy combat veteran who came to my office and showed a personal compassion in that moment of sorrow. That person came to talk about the little dog that I had lost. He had read about the passing of our little dog Billy. He read the story in the newspaper, and he came to my office to express his sorrow. Who was he? That person was the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Robert Smith. He would make about two of me, Robert Byrd. Here he came to my office, took his own busy time to come to my office. This was back in April of this year. He came to my office, paid a special visit to my office to tell me how sorry he was to hear about my little dog Billy. So once again, as I have many times in my long years with which God has blessed me, I came to realize that the people with whom we work here in the Senate often have a personal side that we do not get to know or understand in our working relationships on the Senate floor. Our colleagues are usually much more complex than their public persona would lead one to believe and have facets to their characters that are not often seen in their daily official activities. But Senator Robert Smith's thoughtful expression of sympathy gave me a better understanding and appreciation for this man who for several years now has proudly represented his State in the Senate. He is on the Armed Services Committee with me. I have served on that committee now with him these many years. Senator Smith possesses an admirable quality of perseverance. As a young man, he had to work his way through college. Although he was the son of a naval aviator who was killed in combat during World War II, when Robert Smith was old enough, he enlisted in the Navy and he proudly served our country in combat in Vietnam. He is a person who had to run for Congress three times before being elected. As a Senator, his tenacious adherence to his independent ways eventually cost him his Senate seat. He has often been portrayed as a fierce conservative, but I came to perceive him as the ``citizen legislator'' that he promised to be when he was first elected to Congress in 1984. In his twelve years in the Senate, he has been a forceful advocate of the many and various causes in which he believes, and he has never been deterred by the labels others may place on those views. Bob Smith's politics is not easy to characterize, from his support for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget to helping to preserve and protect our environment, he has defied easy labels. Senator Smith has also been a strong advocate for modernizing his state's and the nation's infrastructure, and for that I sincerely applaud him. He has also tenaciously fought to gain a thorough accounting of American MIAs and POWs. I have probably opposed Senator Smith more than I have agreed with him, but I have consistently been impressed with his independence of spirit and thought, and his dedication to the causes in which he believes. I am confident that in his future efforts he will continue to demonstrate the steadfastness, courage, and integrity that he has exemplified during his twelve years in this chamber. I wish him well in his future endeavors. I hope he will, indeed, come back and visit those who are his colleagues of this date.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.21034095703998,"Topic 2":0.109846154111731,"Topic 3":0.263263147495542,"Topic 4":0.0940859379550343,"Topic 5":0.322463803397713},{"id":"10720010032166","body":"The clerk will call the roll The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.358067148844094,"Topic 2":0.257935697240506,"Topic 3":0.0959193241789914,"Topic 4":0.0853046903280611,"Topic 5":0.202773139408347},{"id":"10720010037877","body":"Mr. President, is there an order for business following the consideration of the pending legislation?","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.246037214973099,"Topic 2":0.0901067962354023,"Topic 3":0.0982008003976899,"Topic 4":0.0770280379850389,"Topic 5":0.48862715040877},{"id":"10720010015787","body":"Mr. Chairman, they have a history of having failures They have had some successes, but none of the successes without those additional components.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.285859152159708,"Topic 2":0.133017950274937,"Topic 3":0.073411308308852,"Topic 4":0.197868716586805,"Topic 5":0.309842872669698},{"id":"10720010042363","body":"Is it appropriate to send my amendment to the desk?","party":"N/A","Topic 1":0.405044100731002,"Topic 2":0.0772285125184688,"Topic 3":0.0727834784626929,"Topic 4":0.0606657832022796,"Topic 5":0.384278125085557},{"id":"10720020042983","body":"If one takes the scoring of this offset, one could posture that, and one could also raise the question that it might not happen.

As a cosponsor of Senator Kennedy's bill, I believe it is crucial that we pass hate crimes legislation in an expeditious manner in order to provide the government with the tools it needs to prosecute the many senseless bias-motivated crimes that occur in our country each year. In the past several decades we have made significant progress in reducing discrimination, yet more needs to be done. This legislation is an important step toward ending the scourge of hate crimes that continues to plague our Nation. Data gathered under the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act about the prevalence of these crimes is sobering. Beginning in 1991, the Act requires the Justice Department to collect information from law enforcement agencies across the country on crimes motivated by a victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Congress expanded the Act in 1994 to also require the collection of data for crimes based upon the victim's disability. For the year 2000, 11,690 law enforcement agencies in 48 states and the District of Columbia reported 8,063 bias-motivated criminal incidents to the FBI. The incidents consisted of 9,430 separate offenses, 9,924 victims, and 7,530 distinguishable offenders. According to the data collected, 53.8 percent of the 8,055 single-bias incidents were motivated by racial bias, 18.3 percent by religious bias, 16.1 percent by sexual-orientation bias, 11.3 percent by ethnicity/national origin bias, and 0.5 percent by disability and multiple biases. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is carefully tailored to ensure a state's ability to prosecute hate crimes, but it provides the Federal government with additional tools to prosecute hate crimes should a state be unable to do so. The legislation extends the Federal law to prohibit hate crimes against victims because of their gender, sexual orientation or disability. In addition, the legislation allows Federal prosecution of hate crimes wherever they occur and under whatever circumstances, thus broadening the previous requirement that the hate crime occur while the victim is engaged in a ``federally protected activity.'' The need for these limited changes in existing Federal hate crimes laws is clear. For example, according to the Justice Department, 16.1 percent of the hate crimes committed in 2000 were motivated by the victim's sexual orientation. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would expand the definition of hate crimes to include those committed because of the victim's sexual orientation--in addition to a victim's gender or disability. A hate crime may meet the federal definition of ``hate crime'' yet the federal government is still powerless to aid in its prosecution. For example, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, our Nation has struggled to prevent discrimination and acts of violence against Arab-Americans. Despite the resolve that most Americans have shown in that regard, tragically, crimes have occurred. On September 15, 2001, Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh-American, was shot and killed at his gas station in Mesa, Arizona. This tragic incident was the most serious of several attacks against people of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent who were targeted in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Although religion and national identity are already protected under current law, the hate crimes legislation before us would give the Federal government enhanced authority to investigate and prosecute these types of crimes. Despite the progress towards ending discrimination over the past decades, it is undeniably clear that raw hatred and its tragic consequences continue to exist in our Nation. Strengthening the Federal government's ability to prosecute hate crimes is an important step towards the eradication of hate crimes in our country. Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to bring the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act back to the floor of the Senate and to join me in supporting this important hate crimes legislation. We have an invaluable opportunity to make a statement that the United States government will not tolerate crimes motivated by bigotry and prejudice, and I look forward to the day when there is no longer a need in our Nation to legislate such changes.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.159287697595888,"Topic 2":0.0555047515518069,"Topic 3":0.0634003266940424,"Topic 4":0.102723687004843,"Topic 5":0.61908353715342},{"id":"10720010028296","body":"Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair will postpone further proceedings today on motions to suspend the rules on which a recorded vote or the yeas and nays are ordered or on which the vote is objected to under clause 6 of rule XX.

In 1987, the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation brought suit against the United States to recover interest earned on their trust funds while those funds were in Special Deposit and IMPL-Agency accounts. The case was filed in the United States Claims court, and docketed as No. 773-87-L. After the Court ruled that the United States was liable to the Fort Peck Tribes and individual Indians for interest on those funds, the Tribes and the United States reached an agreement for settling claims in the case, for the sum of $4,522,551.84. The court approved the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement further provided that the judgment be divided between the Fort Peck Tribes and those individual Indians who are found to be eligible to share in the judgment. On January 31, 2001, the court approved a stipulation between the parties that defined the procedures by which the Fort Peck Tribes' and individual Indians' respective shares in the judgment would be determined and distributed to them. Pursuant to the Court-approved stipulation in the case, on February 14, 2001, a portion of the Tribe's share of the judgment was deposited into an account in Treasury for the use of the Fort Peck Tribes. As provided by the Court-approved stipulation, those funds are to be available for immediate use by the Tribe pursuant to a plan adopted under the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act, 25 U.S.C. 1401 et seq. The Court-approved stipulation further recognized that the Tribe will most likely receive additional payments from this settlement once the work identifying all individuals eligible to share in the judgment is completed and the pro rata shares are finally computed. Those funds, too, are to be available for use by the Tribe in accord with a plan adopted under the Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. As required by the stipulation and the Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act, the Tribe developed a plan for the use of the Tribe's share of the settlement. Under the plan, the Tribe's share of the judgment will be used for tribal health, education, housing and social services program. The Tribe submitted its plan to the Department of the Interior for review and approval. Public hearings were held during which the views and recommendations of Tribal members were heard regarding the plan. The Tribe has been advised that the Department of Interior has no objection to the Tribe's plan and can approve it. However, although the plan was developed and public hearing held during 2001, the Interior Department did not complete its review of the plan, nor submit the approved plan to Congress within the one-year deadline imposed by the Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. As a result, in order for the Fort Peck Tribe to make use of the judgment awarded to the Tribe, it is necessary for Congress to formally adopt legislation approving the Tribe's plan. The proposed bill language, would serve this purpose. This judgment is based on money that rightfully belongs to the Fort Peck tribes and should be moved expeditiously through Congress. I look forward to working with the Committee on Indian Affairs to move this legislation forward. S. 3060.

I am delighted that he has agreed to see to it that California can be held harmless. Under the compromise in this bill, and according to an analysis by the University of Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, California dairymen will receive a net benefit $143.1 million in payments until the end of fiscal year 2005. This means California dairy farmers will receive $78.1 million in fiscal year 2002, $70.7 million in fiscal year 2003, and $19.4 million in fiscal year 2004.

This landmark bill would put the National Science Foundation on a track to double its budget over the next 5 years, while, at the same time, imposing strict new management requirements to ensure that the National Science Foundation continues to spend our money wisely. This Congress has already demonstrated its faith in and reliance on the National Science Foundation several times in recent months, and I hope and expect that we will continue to do so today. Earlier this year, by the overwhelming margin of 400 to 12, we passed a cybersecurity bill that relied on NSF to fund the research needed to protect our Nation's computer systems and networks. At this time last year, we passed by voice vote a bill to initiate the President's math and science education partnerships, a program that NSF is now beginning to carry out; and we have passed appropriation bills that have included generous, if still insufficient, increases for the National Science Foundation. So the 107th Congress is already on record as acknowledging the vital role played by NSF in both research and education, and we have already recognized the Foundation's need for additional funds. Today, we take the next logical step. The scale of NSF's budget today is simply not commensurate with the breadth and importance of its mission. Congress reached that same conclusion about the National Institutes of Health, and we have followed through by doubling that research agency's budget. But health research is not the only kind of research on which our Nation depends. And, indeed, even health research itself depends on advances outside of biomedicine, the kinds of advances that produce new research tools and new understandings of chemistry and physics. So it is time to give NSF, a much smaller agency than NIH, a budget commensurate with its mission. When we look at the new fields of science and engineering that will boost our economy in this new century, fields like nanotechnology, where do we turn to ensure that our Nation's researchers stay at the cutting edge? The National Science Foundation. When we look at the field of information technology, which facilitates every activity in today's economy, where do we turn to ensure that the U.S. remains at the cutting edge? NSF. When we consider our even more urgent need for a highly skilled technologically-literate workforce, where do we turn to ensure that our education system, from kindergarten through postgraduate work, is preparing the people we need? You guessed it, the National Science Foundation. We turn to the National Science Foundation to solve some of our most pressing problems. We cannot turn from NSF when we decide where to invest Federal funds. It is time to give NSF the money it needs. But do not take my word for it. Do not even take the word of all the university and research groups that have endorsed this bill. They are the obvious beneficiaries. Instead, listen to the major industrial entities that are backing this bill, groups like the National Association of Manufacturers, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and Technet. They understand that federally funded basic research, research which industry has little incentive to fund, is needed to keep the American economy humming. But some may still wonder, despite the support for raising NSF's budget, whether the agency can handle such a significant increase. I would argue that there is no agency better placed to handle it. NSF is a lean agency that spends little of its budget on administration. It is the only agency in the entire Federal Government that received a green light rating from the Office of Management and Budget for the quality of its operations. It is repeatedly cited as a model of how Federal agencies should be run. But despite NSF's stellar record, this bill will not allow the agency to rest on its laurels. The bill imposes several new management requirements to ensure that Federal taxpayer dollars are wisely spent. There is a new report NSF must submit to Congress explaining how it decided to allocate its funding. There is a new requirement to ensure that the public has greater access to National Science Board meetings. There is a new joint NSF-NASA advisory committee on astronomy research. Most importantly, there is a new process to prioritize major equipment projects and to manage them more consistently. Right now, there is no way for anyone outside the foundation to understand how these large projects, like new telescopes and research stations, are selected or ranked. Under our bill, the director and the board will have to agree on a list of projects in priority order that will be submitted to the Congress. Actual budget proposals may still have to depart from that order, but at least we will all be starting with the same information in evaluating such budget proposals. Mr. Chairman, this is a responsible bill, it is a needed bill, it is a bill that has garnered widespread support in committee and outside this Chamber, and it deserves support from all of us today. In passing this bill, we do nothing more, and nothing less, than reaffirm some basic principles: That being the world leader in research is important to our Nation's health, defense, and economic well-being; that improving science and math education is critically important; that a great Nation should not skimp on its investments to improve human understanding of natural phenomena. It is through NSF that we turn those principles into actions. To paraphrase Daniel Webster, it is a small agency, but there are those of us who love it. I urge support for this bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.190248397920812,"Topic 2":0.119172795506656,"Topic 3":0.135206373517354,"Topic 4":0.10194878276802,"Topic 5":0.453423650287157},{"id":"10720020032932","body":"Without objection, it is so ordered","party":"N/A","Topic 1":0.444651461278826,"Topic 2":0.23043569782026,"Topic 3":0.110933951398431,"Topic 4":0.0822940610204407,"Topic 5":0.131684828482042},{"id":"10720010066180","body":"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 663, S. 2872.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.135554858075399,"Topic 2":0.159054415366312,"Topic 3":0.107540972112723,"Topic 4":0.293345247791354,"Topic 5":0.304504506654212},{"id":"10720010001802","body":"Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska , a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.","party":"N/A","Topic 1":0.124360688732556,"Topic 2":0.259477036322229,"Topic 3":0.278008853806228,"Topic 4":0.108853039329731,"Topic 5":0.229300381809256},{"id":"10720010053337","body":"Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.","party":"Democratic","Topic 1":0.193748205286968,"Topic 2":0.314995850508278,"Topic 3":0.261467307794906,"Topic 4":0.138219328892442,"Topic 5":0.0915693075174066},{"id":"10720010044886","body":"I say to my friend from South Dakota, I remember a very emotional time when the son of the Senator from South Dakota was called into harm's way in Bosnia, the Balkans, wearing a uniform, carrying a gun, representing the United States.

In large part it originated in this body with legislation offered by Senator Lieberman and Senator Specter, who deserve great credit for their work. President Bush, after initially opposing this idea, also deserves credit for coming to understand its value and for reversing his administration's resistance to it. In the several months that the Congress has spent in writing and debating this complex bill, the issue has not been whether such a department should be created, but how it should be created. The Judiciary Committee, which I chair, has played a constructive role in examining these issues in our hearings and in providing guidance in the writing of this bill, and I have supported and helped to advance the key objectives envisioned for this new department. The fact that we are on the verge of enacting a charter for the new department is good for the Nation and our efforts to defend the American people against the threats of terrorism. Many of the ``hows'' that have found their way into this bill, and the process by which that has happened, are a needless blot on this charter. As we act to approve this charter, we should also feel obligated to remedy many of these ill-advised and ill- considered provisions in succeeding congressional sessions, through corrective steps and through close oversight. As they come to understand some of the imprudent extraneous additions to this bill, many Americans will feel that their trust and goodwill have been abused, and I share their disappointment about several elements of this version of the bill that has been placed, without due consideration, before the Senate. This deal, negotiated behind closed doors by a few Republican leaders in the House and Senate and the White House, has been presented to us as a done deal. It includes several blatant flaws that should at the very least be debated. That is why I could not vote for cloture to end debate on a bill almost 500-pages long that was presented to us for the first time only five days ago, on November 14. The bill undertakes a significant restructuring of the Federal Government by relocating in the new Department of Homeland Security several agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Office of Domestic Preparedness, the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Coast Guard. In addition, many functions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be transferred to the Department of Justice. Overall I support the President's conclusion that several government functions should be reorganized to improve our effectiveness in combating terrorism and preserving our national security, although he has been responsible for leading all of these agencies and fulfilling their responsibilities since assuming the Presidency in January 2001, and the President himself opposed significant reorganization until recently. Homeland security functions are now dispersed among more than 100 different governmental organizations. Testimony at a June 26, 2002, Judiciary Committee hearing illuminated the problem of such a confusing patchwork of agencies with none having homeland security as its sole or even primary mission. I had thought that the Department of Justice and FBI were the lead agencies responsible for the country's security in 2001 and 2002, but I understand why the President has come to realize that the lack of a single agency responsible for homeland security increases both the potential for mistakes and opportunities for terrorists to exploit our vulnerabilities. The bill will bring under one cabinet level officer agencies and departments that share overlapping missions for protecting our border, our financial and transportation infrastructure and responding to crises. Having these agencies under a single cabinet level officer will help coordinate their efforts and focus their mission with a single line of authority to get the job done. This is something that I support. The bill also encourages information sharing. Our best defense against terrorism is improved communication and coordination among local, State, and Federal authorities; and between the U.S. and its allies. Through these efforts, led by the Federal government and with the active assistance of many others in other levels of government and in the private sector, we can enhance our prevention efforts, improve our response mechanisms, and at the same time ensure that funds allotted for protection against terrorism are being used most effectively. The recent sniper rampage in the Washington, DC area demonstrated the dire need for such coordination among Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies. Fortunately, we were able to see the productive results of effective information sharing and coordination with the arrests of the two alleged snipers on October 31. While we all support increased sharing of relevant information with the new Department of Homeland Security by and among other Federal, State and local agencies, we must be careful that information sharing does not turn into information dumping. We want our law enforcement officials to have the information they need to do their jobs effectively and efficiently, with communications equipment that allows different agencies to talk to each other and with the appropriate training and tools so that multiple agencies are able to coordinate their responses during emergencies. We know that large amounts of information were collected, but never read or analyzed, before September 11, and we know that translators and resources are what we need to help make the already-gathered information useful. There is no dispute that information sharing is critical, but we have to make sure we do not go overboard. Information dumping is harmful to our national security if the information is not accurate, complete, or relevant, or if it is dumped in such a bulk fashion that end-users are unable to determine its reliability. The legislation before us provides very broad authority for information collection from and sharing with not just Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities, but also other government agencies, foreign government agencies and the private sector. Highly sensitive grand jury information, criminal justice, and electronic, wire, and oral interception information is authorized to be shared to not just across this country but also around the world. Without clear guidance, this sweeping new authority can be a recipe for mischief. The Congress now will have an imperative to monitor vigilantly and responsibly the implementation of this new authority to ensure that the risks to the privacy of the American people and the potential for abuse do not become a reality. This bill contains several constructive provisions, including establishment in the new Department of a Privacy Office and an Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. The bill also includes the Sessions-Leahy bill, S. 3073, and whistleblower protections that the administration's original proposal rejected. In addition, as I will discuss in more detail in these remarks, the bill includes a prohibition on both the TIPS Program and a national identification system or card. I am pleased the bill, in section 880, forbids the creation of Operation TIPS, a proposed citizen reporting program theoretically designed to prevent terrorism. The ill-designed program threatened to turn neighbors into spies and to discredit valuable neighborhood watch programs. When I questioned the Attorney General about the program earlier this year, I found his answers to be incomplete and far from reassuring. As such, I was prepared to offer an amendment in the Senate to bar Operation TIPS, and I welcome the House's strong opposition to the program that has made my amendment unnecessary. Under the plan originally announced by the Justice Department, Operation TIPS would have enlisted millions of Americans as volunteers who would report their suspicions about their neighbors and customers to the government. This plan was criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike, and Justice Department officials then said they planned to make the program smaller than originally anticipated. But the Department never made clear how the program would work, what it would cost, or how the privacy interests of American citizens would be protected. Indeed, the administration offered a constantly shifting set of explanations to Congress and the public about how Operation TIPS would work, leaving Congress unable even to evaluate a program that could easily lead to the invasion of the privacy of our fellow Americans. Even the Operations TIPS website offered differing explanations of how the program would work, depending on what day a concerned user accessed it. For example, before July 25, the web site said that Operation TIPS ``involving 1 million workers in the pilot stage, will be a national reporting system that allows these workers, whose routines make them well-positioned to recognize unusual events, to report suspicious activity.'' By contrast, the July 25 version declared that ``the program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places.'' It was unclear whether these changes reflected actual changes in the Justice Department's plans, or whether they were simply cosmetic differences designed to blunt opposition to the program raised by concerned citizens, newspaper editorials, and Members of Congress. The administration originally proposed Operation TIPS as ``a nationwide program giving millions of American truckers, letter carriers, train conductors, ship captains, utility employees, and others a formal way to report suspicious terrorist activity.'' In other words, the administration would recruit people whose jobs gave them access to private homes to report on any ``suspicious'' activities they discovered. Nor would this program start small; the Administration planned a pilot program that alone would have enlisted 1 million Americans. We also never received a full understanding of how the Administration planned to train Operation TIPS volunteers. The average citizen has little knowledge of law enforcement methods, or of the sort of information that is useful to those working to prevent terrorism. Such a setup could have allowed unscrupulous participants to abuse their new status to place innocent neighbors under undue scrutiny. The number of people who would have abused this opportunity is undoubtedly small, but the damage these relatively few could do would be very real and potentially devastating. In addition, it was crucial that citizen volunteers receive training about the permissible use of race and ethnicity in their evaluation of whether a particular individual's behavior is suspicious, but the Justice Department seemed not to have considered the issue. Even participants acting in good faith may have been prone to report activity that would not be suspicious to a well-trained professional. One law enforcement agencies are already operating under heavy burdens, and I questioned the usefulness of bombarding them with countless tips from millions of volunteers. As the Washington Post put it in a July editorial: ``It is easy to imagine how such a program might produce little or no useful information but would flood law enforcement with endless suspicions that would divert authorities from more promising investigative avenues.'' The administration's plan also raised important questions about how and whether information submitted by TIPS volunteers would be retained. Many of us were deeply concerned about the creation of a TIPS database that would retain TIPS reports indefinitely. When he testified before the Judiciary Committee in July, the Attorney General said that he, too, was concerned about this. He told us that he had been given assurances that there would be no database, but he could not tell us who had given him those assurances. Many months later, the administration's plans on this issue still are unclear. We simply cannot allow a program that will use databases to store unsubstantiated allegations against American citizens to move forward. Opposition to Operation TIPS has been widespread. Representative Armey, the House Majority Leader, has led the fight against it in the House. The Postal Service refused to participate. The Boston Globe called it a scheme Joseph Stalin would have loved. In an editorial, The New York Times said: ``If TIPS is ever put into effect, the first people who should be turned in as a threat to our way of life are the Justice Department officials who thought up this most un-American of programs.'' The Las Vegas Sun said that ``Operation TIPS has the potential of becoming a monster.'' The Washington Post said that the Administration ``owes a fuller explanation before launch day.'' In evaluating TIPS, we need to remember our past experience with enlisting citizen informants on such a grand scale. During World War I, the Department of Justice established the American Protective League, APL, which enrolled 250,000 citizens in at least 600 cities and towns to report suspicious conduct and investigate fellow citizens. For example, the League spied on workers and unions in thousands of industrial plants with defense contracts and organized raids on German- language newspapers. Members wore badges and carried ID cards that showed their connection to the Justice Department and were even used to make arrests. Members of the League used such methods as tar and feathers, beatings, and forcing those who were suspected of disloyalty to kiss the flag. The New York Bar Association issued a report after the war stating of the APL: ``No other one cause contributed so much to the oppression of innocent men as the systematic and indiscriminate agitation against what was claimed to be an all-pervasive system of German espionage.'' No one wants to relive those dark episodes or anything close to them. I am pleased that we have achieved bicameral and bipartisan agreement that Operation TIPS goes too far, infringing on the liberties of the American people while promising little benefit for law enforcement efforts. If the administration comes to Congress with a limited, common-sense proposal that respects liberties, Congress will likely support it. But Congress cannot simply write a blank check for such a troubled program. I am also pleased that the bill, in section 1514, states clearly that nothing in the legislation shall be construed to authorize the development of a national identification system or card. Given the other provisions in the bill that pose a risk to our privacy, this at least is a line in the sand which I fully support. The House-passed bill also includes, in section 601, a provision that Senator Sessions and I introduced last month as S.3073. This provision will facilitate private charitable giving for servicemen and other Federal employees who are killed in the line of duty while engaged in the fight against international terrorism. Under current law, beneficiaries of members of the U.S. Armed Forces get paid only $6,000 in death benefits from the government, over any insurance that they may have purchased. Moreover, these individuals may not be eligible for payments from any existing victims' compensation program or charitable organization. The Session-Leahy provision will provide much-needed support for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. It encourages the establishment of charitable trusts for the benefit of surviving spouses and dependents of military, CIA, FBI, and other Federal Government employees who are killed in operations or activities to curb international terrorism. This provision also authorizes Federal officials to contact qualifying trusts on behalf of surviving spouses and dependents, pursuant to regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. This will help to inform survivors about benefits and to ensure that those who are eligible have the opportunity to access the money. It will also spare grieving widows the embarrassment of having to go to a charity and ask for money. Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, this provision makes clear that Federal officeholders and candidates may help raise funds for qualifying trusts without running afoul of federal campaign finance laws. I am also pleased that, unlike the President's original, the current bill would ensure that employees of the new Department of Homeland Security will have all the same whistleblower protections as employees in the rest of the Federal Government. As we saw during the many FBI oversight hearings that the Judiciary Committee has held over the last 15 months, strong whistleblower protection is an important homeland security measure in itself. Indeed, it was whistleblower revelations that helped lead to the creation of this Department. The President was vehemently opposed to creating the new Department of Homeland Security for 9 months after the September 11 attacks. Then, just minutes before FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley came before the Judiciary Committee in a nationally televised appearance to expose potential shortcomings in the FBI's handling of the Zacarias Moussaoui case before 9/11, the White House announced that it had changed its position and that the creation of a new cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security was vital. Of course, that made it all the more ironic that the President's original proposal did not assure whistleblower protections in the new Department. In any event, although the new Department has the same legal protections as those that apply in the rest of the government, the protections will mean nothing without the vigorous enforcement of these laws by the administration. The leadership of the new Department and the Office of Special Counsel must work to encourage a culture that does not punish whistleblowers, and the Congress--including the Judiciary Committee--must continue to vigorously oversee the new and other administrative departments to make sure that this happens. While I am glad that the many employees of the new Department will have the same substantive and procedural whistleblower protections as other government employees, I wish that we could have done more. Unfortunately, a Federal court with a monopoly on whistleblower cases that is hostile to such claims has improperly and narrowly interpreted the provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Senators Grassley, Levin, Akaka and I had proposed a bipartisan amendment to this measure that would have strengthened whistleblower protections in order to protect national security. The amendment was similar to S. 995, of which I am a cosponsor, and our amendment would have corrected some of the anomalies in the current law. It is unfortunate for the success of the Department and for the security of the American people that the amendment was not part of the final measure, and I hope that we can work to pass S. 995 in the 108th Congress. The administration was slow to accept the idea for a cabinet-level department to coordinate homeland security, but experience in the months after the September 11 attacks helped in the evolution of the Administration's position. Soon after the President invited Governor Ridge to serve as the Director of an Office of Homeland Security within the White House, I invited Governor Ridge in October, 2001, to testify before the Judiciary Committee about how he would improve the coordination of law enforcement and intelligence efforts and about his views on the role of the National Guard in carrying out the homeland security mission, but he declined our invitation at that time. The administration would not allow Director Ridge to testify before Congress. Without Governor Ridge's input, the Judiciary Committee continued oversight work that had begun in the summer of 2001, before the terrorist attacks, on improving the effectiveness of the U.S. Department of Justice, the lead Federal agency with responsibility for domestic security. This task has involved oversight hearings with the Attorney General and with officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the weeks immediately after the attacks, the committee turned its attention to hearings on legislative proposals to enhance the legal tools available to detect, investigate and prosecute those who threaten Americans both here and abroad. Committee members worked in partnership with the White House and the House to craft the new anti-terrorism law, the USA PATRIOT Act, which was enacted on October 26, 2001. We were prepared to include in the new anti-terrorism law provisions creating a new cabinet-level officer heading a new Department of Homeland Security, but we did not do so at the request of the White House. Indeed, from September, 2001, until June, 2002, the administration was steadfastly opposed to the creation of a cabinet- level department to protect homeland security. Governor Ridge said in an interview with National Journal reporters in May, 2001, that if Congress put a bill on the President's desk to make his position statutory, he would, ``probably recommend that he veto it.'' That same month, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer also objected to a new department, commenting that, ``You still will have agencies within the Federal government that have to be coordinated. So the answer is: Creating a Cabinet post doesn't solve anything.'' In one respect, the White House was correct: Simply moving agencies around among departments does not address the problems inside agencies like the FBI or the INS--problems like outdated computers, hostility to employees who report problems, lapses in intelligence sharing, and lack of translation and analytical capabilities, along with what many have termed ``cultural problems.'' The Judiciary Committee and its subcommittees have been focusing on identifying those problems and finding constructive solutions to fix them. We have worked hard to be bipartisan and even nonpartisan in this regard. To that end, the Committee unanimously reported the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act, S. 1974, to improve the FBI, especially at this time when the country needs the FBI to be as effective as it can be in the war against terrorism. Unfortunately, that bill has been blocked on the Senate floor since it was reported by the Judiciary Committee in April, 2002, by an anonymous Republican hold. The White House's about-face on June 6, 2002, announced just minutes before the Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing with FBI Special Agent Coleen Rowley, telegraphed the President's new support for the formation of a new homeland Security Department along the lines that Senator Lieberman and Senator Specter had long suggested. Two weeks later, on June 18, 2002, Governor Ridge transmitted a legislative proposal to create a new homeland security department. It should be apparent that knitting together a new agency will not by itself fix existing problems. In writing the charter for this new department, we must be careful not to generate new management problems and accountability issues. Yet the administration's early proposal would have exempted the new department from many legal requirements that apply to other agencies. The Freedom of Information Act would not apply, nor would the conflicts of interest and accountability rules for agency advisors. The new department head would have the power to suspend the Whistleblower Protection Act and the normal procurement rules and to intervene in Inspector General investigations. In these respects, the administration asked us to put this new department above the law and outside the checks and balances these laws are there to ensure. Exempting the new department from laws that ensure accountability to the Congress and to the American people makes for soggy ground and a tenuous start--not the sure footing we all want for the success and endurance of this endeavor. We all wanted to work with the President to meet his ambitious timetable for setting up the new department. Senate Democrats worked diligently to craft responsible legislation that would establish a new department but would also make sure that it was not outside the laws. We all knew that one sure way to slow up the legislation would be to use the new department as the excuse to undermine or repeal laws not liked by partisan interests, or to stick unrelated political items in the bill under the heading of ``management flexibility.'' Unfortunately, the Republican leadership and the White House have been unable to resist that temptation, even as they urge prompt passage of a bill unveiled for the first time only 5 days ago. This bill has its problems. As I will discuss in more detail in the balance of my remarks, this legislation has five significant problems. It would: undermine Federal and State sunshine laws permitting the American people to know what their government is doing, threaten privacy rights, provide sweeping liability protections for companies at the expense of consumers, weaken rather than fix our immigration enforcement problems, and under the guise of ``management flexibility,'' it would authorize political cronyism rather than professionalism within the new department. These problems are unfortunate and entirely unnecessary to the overall objective of establishing a new department of homeland security. Republican leaders and the White House have forced on the Senate a process under which these problem areas cannot be substantively and meaningfully addressed, and that is highly regrettable and a needless blot on this charter. Though I will support passage of this legislation in order to get the new department up and running, the flaws in this legislation will require our attention next year, when I hope to work with the administration and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to monitor implementation of the new law and to craft corrective legislation. First, the bill guts the FOIA at the expense of our national security and public health and safety. This bill eliminates a bipartisan Senate provision that I crafted with Senator Levin and Senator Bennett to protect the public's right to use the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, in order to find out what our Government is doing, while simultaneously providing security to those in the private sector that records voluntarily submitted to help protect our critical infrastructures will not be publicly disclosed. Encouraging cooperation between the private sector and the government to keep our critical infrastructure systems safe from terrorist attacks is a goal we all support. But the appropriate way to meet this goal is a source of great debate--a debate that has been all but ignored by the Republicans who crafted this legislation. The administration itself has flip-flopped on how to best approach this issue. The administration's original June 18, 2002, legislative proposal establishing a new department carved out of FOIA exemption, in section 204, and required non-disclosure of any ``information'' ``voluntarily'' provided to the new Department of Homeland Security by ``non-Federal entities or individuals'' pertaining to ``infrastructure vulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to terrorism'' in the possession of, or that passed through, the new department. Critical terms, such as ``voluntarily provided,'' were undefined. The Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to query Governor Ridge about the administration's proposal on June 26, 2002, when the administration reversed its long-standing position and allowed him to testify in his capacity as the Director of the Transition Planning Office. Governor Ridge's testimony at that hearing is instructive. He seemed to appreciate the concerns expressed by Members about the President's June 18th proposal and to be willing to work with us in the legislative process to find common ground. On the FOIA issue, he described the Administration's goal to craft ``a limited statutory exemption to the Freedom of Information Act'' to help ``the Department's most important missions [which] will be to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure.'' . Governor Ridge explained that to accomplish this, the Department must be able to ``collect information, identifying key assets and components of that infrastructure, evaluate vulnerabilities, and match threat assessments against those vulnerabilities.'' . I do not understand why some have insisted that FOIA and our national security are inconsistent. The FOIA already exempts from disclosure matters that are classified; trade secret, commercial and financial information, which is privileged and confidential; various law enforcement records and information, including confidential source and informant information; and FBI records pertaining to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism. These already broad exemptions in the FOIA are designed to protect national security and public safety and to ensure that the private sector can provide needed information to the government. Current law already exempts from disclosure any financial or commercial information provided voluntarily to the government, if it is of a kind that the provider would not customarily make available to the public. Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871 . Such information enjoys even stronger nondisclosure protections than does material that the government requests. Applying this exception, Federal regulatory agencies are today safeguarding the confidentiality of all kinds of critical infrastructure information, like nuclear power plant safety reports , information about product manufacturing processes land internal security measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.18725120029769,"Topic 2":0.127170094356202,"Topic 3":0.295126337913678,"Topic 4":0.26887584247501,"Topic 5":0.12157652495742},{"id":"10720010016189","body":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4635, the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act.

This is an amendment that has been offered to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill which is the pending business of the Senate. I understand a cloture vote will be scheduled for next Tuesday on this particular amendment. I want to speak to this issue for a moment because I think this is an unfortunate time to be bringing this amendment forward, especially since it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I regret an effort has been made to inject this rather emotionally charged issue into the appropriations bill we are going to be asked to vote on early next week. I also think the timing is unfortunate. I understand why, at a time when all of America is willing to and desirous of expressing its appreciation to our firefighters and other rescue workers, especially as they have worked day and night, literally, at the site of the World Trade Center in New York City, to find ways of recognizing their contribution to our country and to the people of New York. I do not think this particular amendment is the way to do that because the amendment seeks to, for the first time, force the U.S. Government's heavy hand into State and local government labor relations with police, fire, and a whole host of other workers--first responders, ambulance, paramedics, EMTs, and a whole group of other people who, for the first time, would be required to comply with Federal procedures regarding collective bargaining rather than the traditional approach, which has been for the State and local governments to make their own determinations as to how to deal with their various employees, including fire, police, and other first responders to emergencies. The timing is unfortunate, as I say. I think there are many better ways for the United States to express its appreciation to these employees than to have a very partisan and contentious issue of labor relations inserted into the appropriations bill under the guise of finding a way to support our police and firefighters. This is not the way to support our police and firefighters. This is an item that has been on the agenda of some people for a long time. To try to insert it into the debate on an appropriations bill at this time I think is most unfortunate. Let me say parenthetically, there are some wonderful police and fire folks in Arizona with whom I have worked over the years. They have been tremendously helpful to me. Arizonans went back to New York City to help in that effort. There is not anybody who appreciates more the work that our police, firefighters, and other first responders do than I. As I say, in particular, the folks in the various organizations that provide police services in Arizona have helped me in more ways than I can tell, but I really do not think this collective bargaining bill, as an amendment to the appropriations process, is the way to recognize their efforts. Here is why. This amendment would require the State and local governments to implement collective bargaining for this group of employees, and it is not limited to paid employees. Volunteer firemen, for example, would be just as subject to this collective bargaining requirement as would the employees of the towns' or counties' police or fire department, for example, because it applies to either paid or unpaid law enforcement officers, firefighters, rescue squads, ambulance crews, as well as paramedics, EMTs, rescue workers, ambulance personnel, hazardous materials workers, first responders, and individuals providing out-of- hospital emergency medical care, both on a paid or voluntary basis. It mandates many categories of individuals that would now be subject to collective bargaining for the first time under Federal rules because under this amendment, within 180 days of enactment, the Federal Labor Relations Authority must determine whether a State provides the following rights--and there is a whole long list: The right to form and join a labor organization; to recognize employees' labor organizations; commit agreements to writing; bargaining over hours, wages, terms of employment, arbitration, enforcement through State courts, and so on. This is obviously an arbitrary list of rights that would be imposed under the authority of the Federal Government. If the FLRA determines that a State does not substantially provide for these rights--and over half of the States do not, by the way, they are right-to-work States that do not mandate collective bargaining--then the FLRA, under this legislation, shall establish collective bargaining procedures for these covered individuals. That has to be done within 1 year of the date of enactment. So the bottom line is it imposes on States, even those which do not currently have collective bargaining laws, a new set of Federal requirements for collective bargaining for these people, including, as I said, even voluntary firemen. It would force this Federal system on those States. It is not just an unfunded mandate, although there is obviously a cost associated with this as well, but it would override all of the local and State laws that currently apply. Twenty-one States do not currently require this kind of collective bargaining. It would literally force upon those governments collective bargaining over these public safety officers, who are nonunion members, to accept the union as their official bargaining agent. This is such a total break from all of the tradition in this country. Some States are right-to-work States. Some States are not right-to-work States. Some States have options for collective bargaining for local jurisdictions, for example, such as my State of Arizona. We have never felt it was appropriate to mandate from the Federal Government how each of these municipalities and States would conduct their labor relations. The bill has a provision that says if you have less than 25 full-time employees, then your police department or fire department would not be covered. Stop and think about all of the towns and the counties throughout our country that may have 26 or 27 or 28 employees. They would be covered. For the first time, the heavy hand of the Federal Government would come down and tell them what to do. It is no wonder that county sheriffs in Arizona and some mayors in some relatively small towns have contacted my office and said: Do not impose this on us. We are getting along fine. We have great relations with our employees, and for the Federal Government to step in is not only going to increase our costs but, frankly, create some bad relationships. We do not need that. We have enough trouble responding to all of the problems that have resulted from September 11 to have to deal with this. This is not an appropriate response to the events of September 11 for us to force this on our State and local communities. In my own State of Arizona, for example, our law provides that public safety employees can present their proposals to their employers but does not require as an obligation that collective bargaining be the result. This, of course, would require the State agencies and local governments to bargain with labor unions on behalf of the public safety employees. This is why the sheriffs as well as some police chiefs have contacted me and said it interferes with their ability. The Arizona sheriffs and police chiefs, the league of cities and towns, all of them have expressed their opposition to this legislation. I think the problem is in opposing it, there is somehow a notion we are therefore against police and firemen. That is what bothers me the most. There is a big difference between the Federal Government mandating labor policies on our towns and counties on the one hand and expressing our support for police and firefighters on the other. We have done that in the Senate in resolutions we have passed. I hope in many other ways to show support for the police and firemen in my State with whom, again, I have had such a great relationship. They have helped me, and I hope I have been able to help them. In fact, I know I have through several appropriations that we have received to help them in fighting drugs, for example. It has been a great relationship, and I hope I do not have to prove my loyalty to these folks by supporting an amendment which has no place in this bill, which is a very political amendment, which creates huge problems with respect to federalism and forcing for the first time this new Federal mandate on these local communities, at a huge cost. By the way, the cost is estimated at $44 million by CBO over the next 4 years. CBO says it will cost $3 million just to set up the FLRA to develop the regulations to determine State compliance and enforce those compliances. This is simply not the right response to the events of September 11. I regret this issue has been infused into the Labor-HHS bill. So I say to my friends in the volunteer fire departments in the small towns throughout Arizona and even in the larger communities, which of course do have these collective bargaining arrangements, for the most part, the best way we can respond to the incident of September 11 is to keep focused on the job ahead of us, and that is to train up and be ready to respond as first responders to any emergency within our local communities; to support our local firefighters and police so that in the myriad false alarms they are now responding to we provide them the resources necessary for them to do their job; to support them in any issues they have with respect to the Federal Government in terms of getting funding for programs and the like; but not to respond by creating a new Federal mandate on every community in our States that now they are going to have to be required to engage in collective bargaining when that has been a matter of local option in the past. It seems to me this is the wrong approach, and I hope we can find other ways of supporting our local fire and police than by this particular amendment. I intend to vote no if the question of cloture comes up. To explain that very briefly, the point is: Should we be taking up this amendment on this unrelated bill? Sixty Senators will have to say yes before we will be permitted to do that next Tuesday. I hope at least 40 Senators will say, no, this is not the place to do it, this is not the way for us to express our support for fire and police. There are more practical ways we could do that given the events of September 11.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.193454386795287,"Topic 2":0.0707640604911606,"Topic 3":0.269591436719999,"Topic 4":0.0662568243618216,"Topic 5":0.399933291631731},{"id":"10720010038349","body":"I also ask unanimous consent that following Senator Nickles, Senator Stabenow be recognized for 10 minutes.","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.132392983592869,"Topic 2":0.288642122761693,"Topic 3":0.217347623002146,"Topic 4":0.142567456020107,"Topic 5":0.219049814623185},{"id":"10720020004825","body":"Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute Offered by Mr. George Miller of","party":"Republican","Topic 1":0.276716850560317,"Topic 2":0.214666776941092,"Topic 3":0.102897625606916,"Topic 4":0.188614925656314,"Topic 5":0.217103821235361},{"id":"10720020008468","body":"Mr. Chairman, May marks National Military Appreciation Month, and I can think of no appropriate way to recognize it than to rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. I especially commend for my colleagues' consideration and support the military personnel provisions of the bill that address continuing realities and challenges by making improvements in the end strength, compensation, personnel and health care systems of the Department of Defense. Let me highlight three of those most important areas. First, while fully supporting the efforts of the Secretary of Defense to reduce operational and mission requirements, this bill reflects the view that the war on terrorism will be a long-term effort and that some growth in military manpower is prudent at this time. Therefore, the bill represents the bipartisan views of all of us, including the gentleman from Missouri , who was a leader on this, and recommends an increase in active duty end strength of nearly 1 percent, or 12,650, above fiscal year 2002 levels. That is the largest single year growth in active end strength since 1985 and 1986. To support the added strength, the bill provides an additional $550 million as well as increasing National Guard and Reserve component full-time manning by some 2,400 personnel. Secondly, the bill provides a military pay raise, as proposed by the President, of 4.1 percent across-the-board for all personnel, one-half of 1 percent more than the average pay increase for private sector employees. In addition, it recommends targeted raises of 6.5 percent to critical mid-grade and senior noncommissioned officers and mid-grade officers, as well as housing rates that will reduce the out-of-pocket housing expenses from the current level of 11.3 percent to 7.5 percent in fiscal year 2003. Finally, as the gentleman from Florida said moments ago, the third major provision I want to highlight would ensure that by 2007 all retirees rated by the Veterans Administration with 60 percent disabled or above will receive both their full military retired pay and their full VA disability pay. This initiative, known widely as concurrent receipts, represents the culmination of a multi-year, bipartisan effort to restore justice in veterans' compensation using the $5.8 billion provided by the House budget resolution for fiscal year 2003. In closing, Mr. Chairman, let me thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Arkansas , for his leadership, for his very active involvement, as well as all members of both sides of the aisle of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel who have a good deal to be proud of in this fine mark and in this great bill.

In 1998, in my capacity of chairing the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I began a 16-month investigation of the safety of imported foods. This investigation revealed much about the Government's flawed food safety net. Regrettably, in the intervening years little has changed, and now we must acknowledge that the systemic shortcomings can also be exploited by bioterrorists. As part of the investigation, I asked the General Accounting Office to evaluate the Federal Government's efforts to ensure the safety of imported food. In its April 1998 report, the General Accounting Office concluded that ``Federal efforts to ensure the safety of imported foods are inconsistent and unreliable.'' Just last month, the GAO reiterated that conclusion in testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management. During the 5 days of subcommittee hearings that I chaired, we heard testimony from 29 witnesses, including scientists, industry and consumer groups, government officials, the General Accounting Office, and two individuals with firsthand knowledge of the seamier side of the imported food industry--a convicted customs broker and a convicted former FDA inspector. Let me briefly recount some of the subcommittee's findings which make clear why the legislation I have introduced is so urgently needed. First, weaknesses in the FDA's import controls--specifically, the ability of importers to control food shipments from the port to the point of distribution--make the system very vulnerable to fraud and deception, and clearly vulnerable to a concerted bioterrorist attack. Second, the bonds required to be posted by importers who violate food safety laws are so low that they are simply considered by some unscrupulous importers to be a cost of doing business. Third, maintaining the food safety net for imported food is an increasingly complicated and complex task, made more complicated by previously unknown food pathogens, such as Cyclospora, that are difficult to detect. Our recent experience with anthrax has taught us there is much that public health officials still need to know when dealing with such pathogens and bacteria. Fourth, because some imported food can be contaminated by substances that cannot be detected by visual inspections, grant programs are needed to encourage the development of food safety monitoring devices and sensors that are capable of detecting chemical and biological contaminants. Fifth, since contamination of imported food can occur at many different places from the farm to the table, the ability to trace outbreaks of foodborne illnesses back to the source of contamination requires more coordinated effort among Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for ensuring food safety, as well as improved education for health care providers so that they can better recognize and treat foodborne illnesses. Again, our recent experience with anthrax underscores the need for better coordination and education. Since the terrorist attacks that occurred just weeks ago, we have been living in a changed world. We are battling enemies who show no regard for the value of human life, and whose twisted minds seek to destroy those who embody democracy and freedom. It has never been as important as it is now to ensure that our food supplies are adequately protected against contamination, both inadvertent and intentional. President Bush and his administration are acting swiftly and decisively on all fronts. Among the responsibilities of the Office of Homeland Security is the protection of our livestock and agricultural systems from terrorist attack. The administration has requested additional funding to beef up security at our borders and to add more inspectors to evaluate the safety of food imports. And the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, has been working tirelessly to obtain the additional tools necessary to combat bioterrorism. On October 17, 2001, Secretary Thompson appeared before the Senate's Governmental Affairs Committee, and testified about the Federal Government's efforts to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to respond to bioterrorist threats. He identified food safety and, in particular, imported foods, as vulnerable areas that require further strengthening. Similarly, at a recent hearing before the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, every single public health expert who testified before us expressed concern about the vulnerability of our food supplies. Weak import controls make our system all too easy to circumvent. After all, FDA only inspects fewer than 1 percent of all imported food shipments that arrive in our country. Those shipments are sent from countries around the world, most of whom wish us no harm. Yet, because of the hard lessons we have had to learn since September 11, we must be more vigilant about protecting ourselves. It is vital that we take the necessary steps to close the loopholes that unscrupulous shippers have used in the past and that bioterrorists could exploit now. I first became concerned about the safety of the U.S. food supply in 1998 when I learned that fruit from Mexico and Guatemala was associated with three multi-state outbreaks of foodborne illnesses that sickened thousands of Americans. Regrettably, those type of outbreaks are far too common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 76 million cases of foodborne illnesses occur each year. Fortunately, the majority of these incidents are mild and cause symptoms for only a day or two. Less fortunately, the CDC also estimates that over 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths result from those 76 million cases. And as astonishingly high as those numbers are, they are estimates, and the truth may be even more deadly. It was because of my concern that I began the subcommittee's investigation of the adequacy of our country's imported food safety system. The testimony I heard was troubling. The U.S. Customs Service told us of one particularly egregious case. It involved contaminated fish and illustrated the challenges facing federal regulators who are charged with ensuring the safety of our Nation's food supply. In 1996, Federal inspectors along our border with Mexico opened a shipment of seafood destined for sales to restaurants in Los Angeles. The shipment was dangerously tainted with life-threatening contaminants, including botulism, Salmonella, and just plain filth. Much to the surprise of the inspectors, this shipment of frozen fish had been inspected before by Federal authorities. Alarmingly, in fact, it had arrived at our border 2 years before, and had been rejected by the FDA as unfit for consumption. Its importers then held this rotten shipment for 2 years before attempting to bring it into the country again, by a different route, and a different port in the hope of shipping this seafood through the inspection system. The inspectors only narrowly prevented this poisoned fish from reaching American plates. And what happened to the importer who tried to sell this deadly food to American consumers? In effect, nothing. He was placed on probation and asked to perform 50 hours of community service. I suppose, given how few shipments are inspected by FDA inspectors, we should count ourselves lucky that these perpetrators were caught at all since, as I mentioned earlier, fewer than 1 percent of all shipments of imported food under the jurisdiction of FDA are actually inspected. Unsafe food might have escaped detection and reached our tables. But it worries me that the importer essentially received a slap on the wrist. I believe that forfeiting the small amount of money currently required for the Customs' bond, which some importers now consider no more than a ``cost of doing business,'' does little to deter unscrupulous importers from trying to slip tainted fish that is 2 years old past overworked Customs agents. It is imperative that Congress provide our Federal agencies with the direction, resources, and authority necessary to protect our food supply from acts of bioterrorism and to keep unsafe, unsanitary food out of the United States. I have worked with the FDA, the Customs Service, and the CDC to ensure that my legislation corrects many of the vulnerabilities that have been identified in our imported food safety system. Let me describe what this bill is designed to accomplish. My legislation would fill the existing gaps in the food import system and provide the FDA with stronger authority to protect American consumers against tainted food imports. First and foremost, this bill gives the FDA the authority to stop such food from entering our country. My bill would authorize FDA to deny the entry of imported food that has caused repeated outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, presents a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or is likely without systemic changes to cause disease again. Second, this legislation would enable the FDA to require secure storage of shipments offered by repeat offenders prior to their release into commerce. Unscrupulous shippers who have demonstrated a willingness to knowingly send tainted food to our country cannot be overlooked as potential sources of bioterrorist acts. My bill would also prohibit the practice of ``port-shopping,'' and would require that boxes containing violative foods that have been refused entry into our country be clearly marked. This latter authority is currently used with success by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. My bill also would require the destruction of certain imported foods that cannot be adequately reconditioned to ensure safety. What happens now is that when the food is ordered to be reexported and denied entrance into this country, it is not destroyed, even if it is completely unfit for human consumption and cannot be made safe. Third, the legislation would direct the FDA to develop criteria for use by private laboratories to collect and analyze samples of food offered for import. This will help ensure the integrity of the testing process. What happens now is that it is often the very same shipper who tried to slip the tainted food into our country who is responsible for taking it to a lab and getting it tested. Obviously, that is like putting the fox in charge of the hen house and offers very little protection to consumers. Fourth, the legislation would give ``teeth'' to the current food import system by establishing two strong deterrents--the threats of higher bonds and of debarment--for unscrupulous importers who repeatedly violate U.S. law. No longer will the industry's ``bad actors'' be able to profit from endangering the health of American consumers. In other words, if the shipper is found to be repeatedly violating Federal laws regarding food safety, we could ban that shipper from importing anything into the United States. We will just kick them out of the business altogether. Finally, my legislation would authorize the CDC to award grants to State and local public health agencies to strengthen the public health infrastructure by updating essential items, such as laboratory and electronic reporting equipment. Grants would also be available for universities, nonprofit corporations, and industrial partners to develop new and improved sensors and tests to detect pathogens, and for professional schools and societies to develop programs to increase the awareness of foodborne illness among health care providers and the general public. We are truly fortunate that the American food supply is the safest in the world. But our system for safeguarding our citizens from imported food that has been tainted, either intentionally or inadvertently, is fundamentally flawed. We need to work together to correct this problem. In that regard, I am pleased to report that I am working with my colleagues on bipartisan bioterrorism legislation that targets problems posed by bioterrorist threats to our Nation's food supply. I believe that the measures provided for in my Imported Food Safety Act of 2001, as well as the bipartisan bioterrorism bill we are drafting, will significantly reduce this potential threat to our country. It is my hope that parts of my bill will be incorporated into the comprehensive bioterrorism bill that we are working on now and that we will pass it this year. Mr. President, we need to take action now. We have identified a threat to our food supply. We know what we need to do to put in place the safeguards that are needed.
